# CrowdStrike: Founders benefit from a double standard in tech

I want to talk about the culture of accountability and how it differs in Silicon Valley for Founders and I want to use the crowd strike outage as a way of talking about that because I think it's a really good example let's imagine for a minute that you are an employee maybe you're a manager maybe you're a director maybe you're a vice president or maybe you're just an individual contributor who's actually keeping the lights on and doing the work anyway what if you went to your next role and you said hey I would like you to hire me by the way I took down a good chunk of the internet and I released a major bug that required a manual reboot of hundreds of millions of Windows machines uh but I'm sure I'll be better this time and please let me come work for you I doubt that that would be the kind of resume or the kind of interview style that would earn you the role yet that's exactly what happened in the story of crowd strike so Mr CTS is the CEO of crowd strike and he was previously the Chief technical officer over at McAfee and as Chief technical officer he oversaw the technical team that was responsible for releasing a bug that looks eerily like the one that was released by crowdstrike this past week it affected Windows machines it was globally impacting it took down a good chunk of the internet the parallels are kind of eerie and despite all of that he went on to continue to serve at Intel after McAfee was sold to Intel once he had vested at Intel and he was free he went on to found crowd strike and he's been the CEO ever since and it got me thinking about how we in tech seem to have a different standard when it comes to Founders and we even have written it down in some places I've seen people talk about right celebrate the idea that Founders are a special crew of people that they are people who should be celebrated for building something regardless of their faults regardless of their flaws and we've had a lot of really prominent flameouts as companies just can't scale as a result and I'm not just thinking of crowd strike in this situation I'm also thinking of Wei workor wework was another example where a Founder was celebrated has subsequently got a bunch of funding I don't know what he's done with it and the whole company flamed out and yet that didn't seem to bother the people who invested another billion dollars in him and I think that the stated rationale is that you want to build with someone who's built before and I I get that to an extent but as someone who values understanding the past as a way of sort of shaping the future or the short hand for that by the way is basanis as someone who appreciates priors as a way of shaping our decisions it feels weird for Founders to be the ones where you ignore the priors like for employees we just obsess over whether or not they've done enough to deserve working for us but for Founders we don't for Founders we say have you built before sure have you grown anything before do you have a world changing idea but we don't ask ourselves did the thing you were building before disappear and smoke and it feels like that's a pretty relevant question to ask and it's definitely top of mind for me because now it's gotten so bad that Mr Curts has been called into Congress to testify and I actually do not know if he is being called in to testify just about this most recent crowd strike issue or if Congress is actually going to open the books and look and ask him about his pattern of behavior as a leader that led to two globally impacting bugs in 14 years I'm not sure I I kind of would guess considering sort of how Congress testimony goes that it might be the ladder they might like dig in and like ask him about his previous work experience if so I bet you that that is the most serious conversation he will have ever had about that that's my sense because Founders just typically don't get the same degree of scrutiny and I think that as a result we sometimes build weaker companies than we should and I think that we sometimes overvalue giving money to existing Founders versus giving money to new Founders and I understand why in the sense that new Founders are an unproven bet but I don't understand why in the sense that the founder you know may be one that you know to have burned out a company and I think that that that really comes back to the Newman Wei work thing if you burn out a company so badly it becomes a major Hollywood movie it probably doesn't make sense for you to build again it just doesn't so so all of this to say I feel like we have a double standard here it matters and I would like to see us think about how we can hold existing Founders accountable to a higher standard while celebrating in welcoming new entrepreneurs who want to build whether or not they want to build with outside Capital that strikes me as a better way to build companies that lost and endure I don't know tell me what you think
