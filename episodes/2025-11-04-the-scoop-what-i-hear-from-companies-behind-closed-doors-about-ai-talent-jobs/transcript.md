# The Scoop: What I Hear from Companies Behind Closed Doors About AI, Talent, & Jobs

These are the things that I wish we told employees more about AI. In other words, there's a lot of corporate communication going on about AI right now, but it's not all upfront. And I think it doesn't always help you in career growth. And having seen a lot of juniors, a lot of mid-career, a lot of senior folks grappling with the realities of an AI transition, what I'm realizing is corporate communication is often very formal and stilted. It doesn't give you all the information you need. But because I've seen so many of these transitions at different scales, I can give you a little bit of the behindthescenes perspective to say this is this is what should be said to you, right? This is the reality. So with that in mind, let me give you the straight talk on what is really going on in the middle of these AI transitions for each of these job levels. I'm going to address honest straight advice for juniors. Things that you should be hearing, maybe you're not, but you should be. Same for mid-level, same for seniors. This is really missing right now. I don't hear it. I don't see it. Most of the advice is generic. I'm going to be really honest and really specific. So, if you are getting started in your career, let's say you're in your first three years, maybe your first 5 years, the thing that you need to hear that most companies won't tell you is that you are in one of two camps. Either you are going to be treasured because you are considered fresh blood and creative and you work really hard or you're going to be on the chopping block. And I know a lot of folks out there who think they're on the chopping block already, not because the company's told them, but because they've heard it on TikTok. The reality is that the chopping block happens because the company can't see the value that you bring to the table. And so the non-obvious piece here, the thing that we don't talk about is how as a junior you were able to show problem-olving ability that makes the company recognize you can't just do this with chat GPT. And the trick is you kind of have to make it up as a junior to earn that in a lot of companies because most companies frame junior level tasks as produce this document, produce this analysis, run this cash flow statement. They're not framing them as challenging tasks. And so they're opening the door for you to be thinking about your work as if it's AI replaceable. But it's not if you actually understand what you're doing. If you're actually given the chance to do problem solving, you won't look as AI replaceable. And so I say that because one of the things I share with companies is that you need to rethink your career ladders. You need to think about juniors differently because juniors are problem solvers. They're just problem solvers with less experience. And you need to be assessing them for problem solving ability. Whether that's engineering problem solving or product problem solving or customer success problem solving, but you're still looking at problem solving ability. And if you want people to be seniors in 10 years, you got to hire them now. There's no other substitute for that. And some companies are figuring that out. Notably, actually, very interestingly, Open AAI is figuring that out. They are actively hiring junior engineers. You might wonder why, right? This is a company that presumably uses AI incredibly well. What's it doing that would make them feel like they need junior engineers? They have found that juniors are very very creative and out-of-the-box thinkers on AI and that they need that particular problem-solving talent because seniors tend to get more stuck in their ways. Seniors tend to find a particular way they like to solve problems and they just apply AI to that and that's what they do and they want that mix where they have the fresh blood and the fresh thinking. If open AI can think about it that way, everybody can think about it that way. And so I think the trick if you are in a junior role is to start to as actively and aggressively as you can push across the spectrum, right? You're on a spectrum from I just produce stuff to I solve problems. You want to be pushing as hard as you can toward problem solving. And if you're not, like if you're stuck on the production side, the only option you have is to show that you are 10 or 20x more productive at producing stuff using AI. So like prompts for producing spreadsheets that I've done or Excel or whatever it is that you're working on, show that with AI, you can do so much more. And that becomes a way for you to sort of secure some career stability even if the company hasn't figured out that your real value is over on the problem solving side. Let's move to mid-career. If you're looking at a mid-career role, what you should be thinking about is how can I very rapidly develop deeper and richer domain expertise. Typically, we think if we're mid-career, call it 5 to 10 years in, we want to be developing skills that would get us to senior level. The skills piece is easier to get nowadays because of AI, but the domain piece, the expertise piece is rarer and harder to get. And so, if you're looking for something that sort of gives you sense of stability, a sense of hope, etc., you want to be doubling down on the particular niche that you're in. Now, I know not everybody's in a niche that they're happy with. I have no illusions about that. I've talked with a lot of folks who are very unhappy. Sometimes they're unhappy with you're unhappy with job roll, right? You're unhappy with the particular niche you're in. Maybe it's fintech, maybe it's gaming, whatever it is. I get it. The reality is, as difficult as that is, that domain expertise represents years of accumulated experience that differentiate you from juniors. And you don't want to let that go lightly, even if you don't love it. And so, a smarter way to transition is to start to look at an adjacent role or domain that carries with it some credit for the expertise you have and make a gentle hop. Making a big hop right now as a mid-career person is much, much riskier. You don't know where you're going to land. You don't know if you'll be given credit for your years of experience. Now, if we go back to the skill side, I talked about skills as something that's easier to develop. One of the ways that you can show that is by mapping out your own skill trajectory, particularly in terms of problem solving with AI. If you were mid-career, you should be able to say, "This is how I'm proactively socializing my prompts. This is how I'm proactively talking with the rest of the group about task decomposition so I can pass stuff to AI. This is how I'm verifying my AI outputs." These are things that were previously only usable for machine learning engineers, right? But now everybody has to do them because we have LLMs. And at the mid level, you're going to just be expected to know them. There's not really another substitute for that. If we move to seniors, the thing to capture is that seniors have the most grace on AI right now. you I actually know of companies that are changing their hiring practices to not assess for AI because they don't want to miss seniors. Seniors have systems understanding. They have deep experience 10 to 15 years or more. And this is true whether you're a very experienced PM or an engineer or a CS lead or a sales lead. You're very deep in your space, right? People desperately need that experience. And so I hear a lot from folks who have some gray hairs like me and they wonder what is going to happen to me. I feel like I'm so experienced that people won't give me a shot. I think it's encouraging to know that people are really reframing their hiring practices to require less AI of seniors so they can bring them in because they know that seniors can learn the AI and they'll have the wealth of domain expertise and the problem solving experience and everything else that goes with being a senior and be able to apply it to AI very very rapidly. And that is encouraging, right? That is encouraging if you're someone who's trying to figure out how to make that transition because it means that you have a little bit more grace and people are trusting you more. Like mid-level folks, you need to be leaning in on the experience that you have. Unlike mid-level folks, you get some credit for problem solving ability and sort of articulating things from a uh problem framing and solutioning perspective. and your previous experience at standing up things independently and building systems, all of that you get credit for because you've done it before and you've done it without AI. And so people are just sort of assuming you can start to lean in and essentially do that with AI. And that's exactly what we see when Open AI going back to their hiring plan also hire super senior people. They want people who are deeply experienced who use AI as well because you can supercharge your own problem solving experience for decades with AI. Now, the best organizations have a mix of levels. And I'm just going to say it plainly. If you're in hiring and you're not hiring for a mix of levels, you're missing out. And if you think you need justification, just point to OpenAI. They're hiring for a mix of levels. It's what the best people are doing. And if you're worried that you are not going to be able to figure it out or be able to make the transition, I hope that this video has helped you to name both your level and some of the specific tricks and techniques that you need to use. I'm talking very specifically because I think people get lost in the sauce, right? People think I'm a junior. I need to have a very active GitHub. I didn't say that, right? I'm a mid-career person. I need to have a personal portfolio website. I also didn't say that. What I'm trying to show you is how you apply your particular experience set to the larger challenge of showing you can solve problems for the business because that is what you will be rewarded on. And AI is just a tool to do that. And I want to give you a sense that is taken literally from my conversation with Fortune 100 leaders, conversations I've had with entrepreneurs. I see a real range of scales. These are the things leaders are thinking and talking about. These are the skills that are being looked for. This is not usually talked about this frankly. And so I wanted you to have it. I hope it's helpful for you. Um and I've obviously written up some more sort of in-depth on the Substack on this because I think it's a really important conversation. We need to have like an honest fireside chat that is not just what the company can tell you because this is a really fraud issue. It's much bigger than what one company has. So, I hope this is helpful. Good luck uh with your career. other.
