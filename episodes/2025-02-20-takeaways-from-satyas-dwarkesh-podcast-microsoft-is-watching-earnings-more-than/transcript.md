# Takeaways from Satya's Dwarkesh podcast: Microsoft is watching earnings more than AI

Sachin Adela just gave an hourlong podcast with dwares dwares is one of the most influential podcasters in Silicon Valley but I'm not interested in just summarizing for you I want to actually call out what happened between the lines of that podcast because Sacha gave us some really interesting Clues as to how he's thinking and frankly not all of it makes sense let me lay out a couple of examples on the one hand Sacha says artificial general intelligence really ought to be measured by global GDP growth can AGI achieve 10% Global GDP growth he says and I think that's a fair ask if you're going to set lofty standards and say this is going to change the world you should be able to show that it's actually going to change the world in terms of overall economic Prosperity that would be trillions of dollars in economic impact to be clear like on the order of 10 trillion or so per year and yet in the same breath he refuses to invest in fact he says that capex for Microsoft is something that he's kind of cautious about he doesn't really want to overinvestment back well I have a suggestion one of them is that Microsoft isn't winning consumer Ai and SAA actually touches on this in the podcast he talks about Chad GPT being a massive success story for open AI they've hit 400 million monthly active users they're doing phenomenally well they're easiest easily the biggest consumer success story in AI by like a mile but Bing isn't there co-pilot really isn't there for for consumers and Sacha moves away from consumers Sacha spends a lot of time talking about Enterprise and that's not super surprising because Enterprise is something that the street was really worried about during Microsoft's last earnings call and whatever dh's official audience might be Sacha has the Wall Street uh analysts in mind when he gives these kinds of podcasts he wants to show how Microsoft is being cautious on capex so that it can continue to pcee demand from customers on AI development he does not want to get hammered again in the markets in the next quarter because he overinvestment and how that's a real breakthrough and how it's something that's going to be a leg up for Microsoft long term Etc conveniently the quantum Computing breakthrough that he's talking about is not the kind of balance sheet hit that massive AI capex is and that leaves Sacha free to say AI is not a winner take all Market uh AI is something that we can have multiple winners in Microsoft can slow down a little bit and still be a winner is the implication Microsoft can solidify its Enterprise AI mode and effic effectively saches says AGI isn't so close in his view that he has to worry about investing a ton of money right now or else he's going to miss the boat that is almost exactly the opposite of what Zuckerberg said a month ago we have major CEOs on different sides of this BET right now and I think that's really interesting at the moment SAA seems to be choosing optionality he's hedging his bets he seems to be sort of wanting to be in on AI to the extent that it supports earnings but not so far into that he wants to invest super heavily ahead of demand we'll see this is a guy who is still putting his $80 billion in on AI this year so it's not that he's pulling back but he's being cautious and he's signaling to the street that he's not just going to keep pouring endless cash in I think his position doesn't entirely make sense but I think it makes for a good set of Microsoft talking points for the street I'm curious to hear what you think cheers
