# The Prompt is Becoming the Product

I want to talk about the idea of the prompt becoming the product with 03. One of the things I've been reflecting on is that prompt engineering for a long time with pre-trained models was prompt engineering for the purpose of getting a response that you would then use somewhere else. But with 03 with 04 mini high, the answers can be so complete that in some cases in many cases you don't need to do a lot of reprocessing from there on out. And for for our purposes as prompters, the prompt is becoming our work product. And it's worth thinking about it in those terms especially as you layer in the fact that these newer models are also agentic. And so you can tell 03 or you can tell 04 mini high go fetch my competitor websites every week, make a scheduled task, come back with this, this, this and this, and it will do it. They are functionally agentic models with a lot of tool calling ability. And they're not the only ones. There are other models out there that are agentic as well. But I'm calling them out because they're widely distributed. And I'm calling them out because they are making the underlying technology of Agentic tool use much more transparent to the general user than it's been before. Prior to the launch of real agentic in chatbot uh conversational models, you had to go to N8N, you had to go to Lindy, you had to go to Langraph, you had to go a lot of other places to get agents really going for you and lots of people did that and those businesses are doing well. But the mass adoption footprint you get with a gentic is really interesting in this situation and has reminded me of one of the fundamental through lines in product from technology to product to magical customer value. You can trace that line with the iPhone. You can definitely trace it with chat GPT which is on track to hit a billion users in 3 years which is roughly three times faster than Facebook. And the thing that I'm thinking about as I sort of meditate on that idea of technology to product to customer value as a through line that is simpler and clearer with better products. You know, if the model is better when it's released, if it makes that line even simpler and clearer than it was when the last model was out. And as I think about it, one of the things that stands out about the release of 03 and 04 mini high is they make this idea of agents and tool calling simpler and clearer than it was. And therefore they challenge us to prompt differently. Our prompting becomes more of the final product. Our prompting needs to be clear about our purpose. Our prompting needs to be clear about expected outputs. And I think that imposes different kind of work responsibilities on us. I don't think we've thought enough about how rumés change. I don't think we've taught enough about how work experience changes, how expectations of performance change. Those are all really rich areas where we need to figure out how to level up. And that's much beyond a particular model release. It doesn't matter whether 03 ultimately is successful or is retired next week. I don't think it's going to get retired next week. And it doesn't matter if DeepSc drops, you know, the next version a week after that and it's incredible. I'm sure they they'll do great things. The point is there's an arms race to simplify this incredible through line that is bringing large language model the underlying technology with tool use through the product phase to magical customer value. And as all of these model makers compete to deliver on that ecosystem, we have to think about how our prompts change and how our prompts are more and more our ultimate work product. And that's a strange thought. I don't know about you but I did not expect to live in a world where my prompts were my work product.
