# Why AI is structurally superior at specific architecture work

I wanted to ask a provocative question. What if we've been thinking about all of this backwards? What if there are specific dimensions of architectural work where AI isn't just adequate but structurally superior to humans? Not because of intelligence, but because of attention span, memory, and the ability to hold an entire codebase sort of in mind while evaluating a single line change. And increasingly as you get larger and larger context windows and searchable context that becomes a more viable mental model to imagine for our AI agents. This is not a pmic about AI replacing architects. Architects still have a key role as you'll see. It's actually an attempt to reason backwards from key principles that underly architecture and understand where cognitive advantages actually lie for humans and AI in the space and think about what that means for how we build software together as AI partners with us in 2026 and beyond.
