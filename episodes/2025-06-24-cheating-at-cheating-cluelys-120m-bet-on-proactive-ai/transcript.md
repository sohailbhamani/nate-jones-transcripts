# Cheating at Cheating? Cluely's $120M Bet on Proactive AI

cheating, cheating, cheating. That's what I've been hearing about Clo ever since they raised $15 million from A16Z just a few days ago. And this is not a story about that raise. Nor is it a story about Roy Lee, even though every newspaper I've come across has talked about Roy getting kicked out of Colombia and how that's like a key part of the founder narrative because he got kicked out for building this tool that helps him cheat. It's just I got to take my hat off to these guys. Roy and team have done a phenomenal job turning the entire narrative about the company into cheating. And it's not about that. It's not I want you to just take off your assumptions about what Clo is really about for a second. It's not about cheating. I know they want you to think about that. They freaking have a manifesto on their website that says cheat at everything. I get that they want you to think about that and they're very good at it, but set it aside. I would argue that they're cheating at cheating. I'm going to explain why. Cluey is really in the business of introducing you to level two proactive AI agents. Cluey is one of the first that's implemented that successfully. I'm super impressed with their UX. I am not impressed with their AI model. I think their AI intelligence is mid. And to be honest with you, having played around with it and used it, it feels like chat GPT40 level intelligence and if you're going to use it and assume the answers are right and give the answers on the tests and give the answers on the interviews and cheated everything, I got news for you. It's going to sound like AI slop. It is. Just like the resumes that come in now are all perfect will sound like AI slop. No, it's not the model. What matters is the UX and the way proactive AI agents are implemented. And I strongly suspect Roy and the team know that the model is not as good as it could be and not as good as it will be. And they're deliberately using aggressive marketing. They have seven marketers and four engineers. aggressive aggressive marketing to jam open the door on the distribution channel to jam open the door on branding to hold a space to hold mind share all those newspapers writing about Roy cheating and so on and so forth free mind share earned clicks they're holding mind share with their target market of Gen Z and Gen Alpha they want to build the habit of daily usage for a tool that is across every app that you use if you use Clo it sits as an invisible pane of class across everything. If they build the sticky habit, you will never leave. So, they're ready when chat GPT5 comes along. They're ready when chat GPT6 comes along. I would say Claude here, but Claude is too ethical to work with Cluey. In fact, one of the really interesting things when I analyzed the prompt for Cloy is that Clo maximizes utility to the user in their prompt and Claude has strong ethical guard rails. And I think that's fascinating. I talk about that a little bit in the uh Substack that I wrote about this. I think the thing I want you to take away, it's not about the cheating, as I've said, it's about the fact that proactive AI agents are going to be everywhere. And Cluey shows us what that's like. It's not going to be the chatbot that chat GPT is using. In fact, chat GPT faces more of an interesting competitive risk from Cluey than Cluey does from chat GPT. Because if you start using Clad GPT feels like P. It doesn't feel like the place where the value is. I I saw it and I felt it when I was using Cluey. I used Cluey to watch a YouTube video with me and I talked to Cluey about the YouTube video about a technical topic. Yeah, the intelligence wasn't in incredible, but it was good enough to get me moving forward. I talked to Cluey about a web design problem I was having, figuring out CSS stylesheets. And I was working with Claude Code and I was working with 03. and Cluey was helping me go back and forth and sort out what was going on. And Cle was writing suggested code to help illustrate the problem based on what it actually saw on my screen. This is not a cheating tool. This is an agentic proactive tool that layers across all of your apps. But it's brilliant. It's brilliant to categorize it as a cheating tool because that's one word that is high impact, that is emotional, that divides generations, that sort of taps into this sense of of we deserve this and we're not going to get it that I hear from so many of my friends and colleagues who are Gen Z. And so I and that's not me talking like I I get it, right? But the marketing is designed to hit that button emotionally as as a marketer who has sat in the marketing chair. That's extremely deliberate and Roy is a little bit honest about that in some of his interviews. So if you're going to talk about Cloy, you need to separate the marketing piece from the product piece. You need to understand that what A16Z really invested in is the product piece. They invested in essentially smart marketing, incredible distribution channel targeted at people who are just coming into peak buying power, who are forming the first AI native generational habits now. And said, "Yes, this is going to be a tool of the future. This is going to be a workflow tool for everything." And then on top of that, Clo shows up and cuts seven figure deals with businesses. We've been talking about people like Gen Z, Gen Alpha, college students the whole time. Think about it from a business perspective. They're cutting seven figure deals because customer success needs a clue to have good conversations. Sales needs a clue. Hey, let me share my screen and cl's in the background. You never know it. It hides. I can't show you a screenshot of Cluey cuz it doesn't screenshot. It's designed to be invisible, but it's there to help you. I do think they're on to something about the future of AI there. And yes, the cheating branding is controversial, but we are going to see a lot more folks who are focused on the utility of AI. And I think that there's a little bit of a generational shift here where people who are younger, people who are deeper in AI, I'm not younger, let's just be honest, uh are going to feel more comfortable with AI augmentation being part of the normal human experience than people who are less native on AI. And this is like clearly is AI augmentation. It just is. Now, you can do AI augmentation and still be smart about it. It doesn't have to sap your brain power. You don't have to do like, "Hey, this is the answer. I just have to give up and say this is the answer." No. Like I I one of the things I did when I was like writing the post for Cluey is I looked at how often I argue with AI. It's about 70% of the time. 70% of AI responses I'm like, "No, that's incorrect." Or, "No, I disagree." Or reframe that. Maybe I'm not the typical user. I'm almost certainly not the typical user. Let's just be honest. But the reality of using tools like Cloey to essentially expand your ability to understand your world and then apply a critical lens to it is huge. And some people will take it and they will just take the answers at face value. And I would tell you that in the next 6 12 18 months once everybody gets these whether they're cluey or something else that is no longer a cheat code. as a cheat code, as a cheat code clearly is inflationary. Say that five times fast. It's inflationary because as soon as everybody has it, it's no longer an edge. Just as as soon as everyone had chat GPT, the ability to write a resume was no longer an edge. All of them are perfect now. And so it's not the cheating that's interesting in the big scheme of things in 18 months. It's not the cheating that's interesting. It's the proactive AI revolution. It's the ability to open up the distribution window a little bit ahead of the model capability. It's the ability to design a proactive agent experience. It's the ability to actually be in a position from a UX perspective where you could actually unseat Chad GPT. That's fascinating. That's why I think the Cluey story is worth diving into. So if you want to learn more, have a read of the article. Cheers.
