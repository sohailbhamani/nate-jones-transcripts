# Capturing Megatrends: Building a Long-Term Product Strategy with Figma

so today I want to talk about product strategy about figma and about how successful companies and successful product managers can latch onto larger trends that are in the industry to build really successful long-term approaches to solve real problems for people and we're going to make it specific because like who really has the time to do this generally we're going to talk about figma and we're specifically going to talk about the motion that figma had from getting started as a company all the way through to their most recent their most recent release which is slides uh and slides is a wonderful example of how you can build a Capstone product on top of an existing strategy if you've been diligently working at this for a long time now the best strategies are strategies that capture Mega trends that affect all of us for years in and so you might wonder what did figma do right like where's their strategy well the truth is figma figured out earlier than most people that software was going to become collaborative one of the defining characteristics of software in the 1990s software in the 2000s was that it was an individual activity that you did at your computer at the beginning you would literally go and you would get software on desk and you would put it on your machine and you would compute on the machine now we're not really talking about Computing as like a cloud service right that's a whole separate conversation we'll do a separate YouTube video on that we're talking about Computing as an activity designed to produce economic output for a worker which sounds really dry but at the end of the day fundamentally most productivity software for businesses is built around the idea of can it make you more efficient at your job that's what companies like auna pitch all the time so with figma what they figured out their core Insight what they believed was true five 10 years and in the future when they got started was that software was going to move from being this individual activity to being something that we all work on together and they pick design as the way to do that because design is one of the more collaborative job Families how many times if you work in engineering if you work in product if you work in marketing have you been talking with a designer about the way something is framed or structured or designed so that it affects the customer in the right way so the customer can get their job done more efficiently whatever it is it is a collaborative art it is easier to be collaborative if you can all be in the tool together see what you each are doing if you have Canvas OR space to comment and talk and frankly Adobe was late to the game on that adobe was not investing in that with their sketch product they viewed productivity in the old 1990s way as let's just get this on Dis Let's get this downloaded let's get this worker a seat that we can monetize and off we go so if you're figma that's a massive opportunity right but there's a huge technical challenge which by the way is a reason to start a business not to stop it because at the end of the day if you are solving a big technical challenge you're fundamentally making a difficult promise come true for customers and that is hard to beat if you can do it if you can get it right now figma was really hard because they basically had to take software that everyone had assumed you could write on a computer program that you can use your whole computer to to employ and and work against and they had to put it all in a little light browser which is a much smaller envelope for your application and they did it just took a long time and so when we talk about sort of the Saka of silicon bellet companies which ones have started quickly which ones have not figma's a slow one figma took a long time to really get going four or five years I think and one of the reasons why is because they had to solve a whole bunch of complicated technical problems to get into the browser and have a smooth collaborative experience in order to take vage of that Nega Trend now I want you to think about something if you are solving a hard challenge but you're not solving in the direction of a larger Trend what's going to happen in four or five years when You' solved it you're going to be off Trend and so it's so important to understand where is the trend going over the long term and how can you be infront of it and in a sense startups are about seeing the future a little bit more accurately than everybody else and in this case for the specific kind of work figma saw the future more accurately they saw that people were going to want to collaborate they'd be hungry for it if they could deliver the product so when they finally did four or five years later people latched on to it I remember when every design director I knew was getting figma installed at their workplace and rolling Adobe back out and I think that's part of why you know a few years later Adobe tried to acquire figma because they saw that they kind of missed the boat um they missed the boat on collaborative software and they needed to spend some of the cash that they had on hand to change that and get back in the game and that's how larger companies often do it like if they miss the boat on a particular Trend they'll try and buy their way out so let's get back to figma at the end of the day when you have this core product you've launched they have figma they launch it it's collaborative it starts to take off the natural thing to do is to add more features to that product when people tell you to add them right you talk to your customer your product manager Now talks to the customer they add a feature it's a little Widget the widget goes inigma the product manager takes their hat off and says job well done everybody great job that's a path to feature bloat that's a path to unhealthy product long term regardless of the micro results what you need to do is understand what are the things that your customers are saying about adjacent problem spaces that you can solve using a similar approach so yes you do need to listen to your customers but don't listen to them if what they are telling you to do is going to make your product more complicated to use or only available to Super users listen to it if it's going to enable you to solve meaningful problems for them across more and more workflows so in this case with the slides released just fast forwarding to the present and there's other ones we can talk about that figma has done I'm just using slides as an example because it's recent at the end of the day what they realized is that designers were already using figma and not just for design they were already using figma for presentations but it wasn't clean it wasn't easy to do other people couldn't get in there and use it as a slide Creator really easily so they decided to change that and it was a Leap Frog motion for them because the the thing that they are now worried about getting disrupted by is of course AI so they needed to find a way to start to compete in the AI space as well and what better way to do that than by getting AI which is deeply informed by text because we have so many large language models now and that's like the heart of the movement I know there's a big image generation movement and I know that's a factor in design they went all in on large language models I think partly because those are so influential right now for business that being said they go in on slides and what they realize is that they have an opportunity to level up the actual core presentation experience yes customers are asking for slides by their behavior they're basically saying I use this for presentations and figma noticed but what they probably didn't say clearly because I've done a lot of customer interviews and they almost never say this is please can I have an AI powered applet called slides where I can actually show my clickable demos as if it was a slide presentation that's what they built almost never do your customers ask that clearly that was up to the imagination of the product and design teams and the engineering team at figma to figure out from what the customers were doing and presenting those slides and to say how can we take this and tie it back back to this larger Trend this larger strategy where we're working on collaborative software and how can we continue to build on that into more workflows this slide or presentation workflow is a new one for them people were using their software for it but it was kind of a hacky use case so if they wanted to build it right they had to understand that workflow and they had to apply figma's knowledge of how to do collaborative software to that new workflow that's really the heart of what makes slides tick and that's why I think it's a great example of how you start to build on Trend over time because now slides is out and all of a sudden people are able to interact with this PowerPoint presentation beyond the canvas and so just like we are now thinking about design as a fundamentally collaborative exercise figma is inviting us to think about presentations as a fundamentally collaborative exercise and yes designers will probably be the ones that use this most often initially but the idea of having strong collaborative activity is something that figma is really good at and that they are extending into more workflows and I think that we as product managers we in Tech often don't have that degree of consistency of vision we don't start out years and years ago building something for a future we think is possible around a megat trend consistently solve a hard technical problem finally get something done that many people thought was impossible by the way getting figma into the browser people thought that wasn't going to get done and then keep building on that right like we don't just build bloatware after that like keep relentlessly building on the core value that we have discovered that people like to collaborate they need to collaborate and that that accelerates value so I'm not a figma person I don't work at figma I don't have figma stock or anything like that I just think this is a wonderful case study for people who study product strategy and I wanted to kind of take it and open it up I've done a shorter version of this on my Tik Tok but I thought this would be a good place to sort of have a long form discussion I hope you enjoyed it
