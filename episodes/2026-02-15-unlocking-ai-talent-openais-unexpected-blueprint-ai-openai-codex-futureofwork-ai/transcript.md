# Unlocking AI Talent: OpenAI's Unexpected Blueprint! #ai #openai #codex #futureofwork #aiimpact

I I think honestly it'll be a surprise to a lot of folks to hear that there are junior engineers at OpenAI simply because there's been a widespread perception over the last 12 months that these tools can dramatically accelerate people who know enough of the business context and have the experience to utilize them and then juniors coming in like I hear from juniors directly saying I you know can't for the life of me get a role anywhere uh because I don't have experience and now you also need to have the ability to have that experience and leverage it with AI and it's even harder and higher But you you guys have juniors and they're apparently doing very well. What's that been like? >> It's been awesome. Uh I think it brings such a joy uh to to work as well and like fresh perspective and then keeps like us grounded. Um >> and I have been delightfully surprised uh about like you know how well that's been working for us. uh and it's changed my perception as well of like you know what is important like know this adaptability and then you you you look at the way that you know they are using AI today and you get inspired and so it's been actually really interesting of like how they've been able to level up the rest of the him.
