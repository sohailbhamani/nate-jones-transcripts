# Claude Skills—From TOY to TOOL: Grab My Tutorial + Custom Skills To Help You Build Skills Fast

Claude skills took the world by storm last week. This video is all about giving you a complete tutorial so that you know how to build a skill yourself by the end of this video. But we're not done there. We are not only going to teach you how to build a skill. I'm going to walk you through the common pitfalls that I see. And I'm also going to make sure that you understand the kinds of skills that you can use to help build other skills. I call them meta skills. They aren't very widely in circulation yet. I've built a bunch of them for this video and I want to walk through several of them with you so you one know they exist and can grab them and two know how to make them because I think that's the more valuable piece. So with that, let's get to it. First, the big picture. Skills are a way to extend what Claude can already do by giving it very specialized instructions and tools. They save a lot of weight on the prompt, which is something I pointed out in my first video right after Claude launched. So, think of them like plugins or extensions. You have one format and you have three ways to use it. Fundamentally, Claude code can read skills directly from folders on your computer. The web or desktop version requires you to upload files through settings. Traditionally, that has been zip files. And by traditionally I mean for the last week now they also can accept a skill file type which is brand new that Claude has introduced. I'll get to that later. Finally, the API lets you create and version skills programmatically. One critical requirement, you must enable code execution or file creation in your settings on the app or skills will not work at all. And I saw people get tripped up by that. Speaking of trip ups, I have now seen a bunch of people's skills in the wild. I've seen people in my DMs asking me about skills since I did my initial video. I want to give you the top 10 things that have tripped people up since Claude Skills launched and how to address it. Number one, every platform wants skills packaged differently. And that is super annoying, but it remains true. So, Claude Code expects folders in specific locations like /skills and web and desktop apps will only accept zip files or skill files, which by the way guys, if you're wondering what a skill file is, it looks like it is just a fancy extension on the end of a zip. And I know that because I threw a skill file into chat gpt and guess what? It still works. Chat GPT can crack it open if you tell it's a zip file and can look inside and tell you what's in there. So, you know that hack I gave you last week where I said you can use these skills in chat GBT chats? Yeah, you can still do that. That still works. If you upload a zip file to the web version, Claude code will not see it unless you extract it to the right folder. This is another thing that trip people up. Basically, Claude lives locally on your computer, but also in the web. And if you upload a skill, it doesn't magically transfer to both places. So, you have to think about where you want the skill to be accessible and do you need to put it in a local folder? Do you need to upload it to the web or the desktop so you can chat with it in the interface? That's up to you. I'm going to demonstrate the interface because it's easier for people to understand, but I wanted to give you a sense of the breadth of Claude so you understand why people get tripped up. Trip number two, people forget to enable code execution. I said this at the top of the video, you got to enable code execution. If it isn't enabled, you can't upload skills and you can't run them. Number three, skills don't trigger when you expect them to. This one's trickier, but Claude decides which skill to use regardless of the surface. If you're on Claude Code, if you're on the web, whatever, it decides to use a skill based on your description. So, a vague description means Claude might not pick your skill or might pick the wrong skill. That means the first lines of your skill.mmarkdown need to be extremely specific about what it does. Your skill.mmarkdown, by the way, is just a plain text file that Claude can help you build or you can build directly that then gets zipped up into a zip file, which Claude will accept, or this fancy newskll ending on the file type, which is basically the same as a zip, but Claude decided to make it fancy. Essentially, if that first line of text isn't super clear, you're going to miss out. And you'll see in the tutorial in a second what I mean by super specific, cuz I have an example. Number four, versioning chaos matters. If you are someone who uses claude code and the interface and the app, you need to think about which is true and real and how you version these things. So pick a source of truth and then put that skill into every place you can think of if you're one of those users that use all the surfaces. Otherwise, you're going to get confused. This brings me to number five, which is there is a limit on the number of skills you can access, at least in the web and app versions. Claude limits you to 20 uploaded skills and it does enforce it. I have already hit that limit and I have to make hard choices. So think about the skills that you are going to choose to invest in and make sure you pick the right ones. I expect that to shift as Claude gets more capable over time, but that's the limit we're at today. Next, you need to be ready for a team level of confusion around skills if you don't impose a degree of order on common skills because claude right now is just going to let everybody upload everything in their own cloud instances. And if you're in a team's instance, that means that everyone is going to have their own version. There is no push to everyone button for skills yet. I expect we'll get there, but it doesn't exist. So, everyone has their own individual skills. And if you're an administrator in a team's instance, if you're trying to manage an enterprise install for claude, that's something you'll have to think about. That, by the way, is also true if you are one of those people who's doing the hack I mentioned in my first video where you're using these in chat GPT. Everyone in chat GPT is going to be using these sort of skill things individually as a hack. And there isn't going to be a teamwide instance unless you decide to create a repository of skills that everybody has to draw from. So think about that if you are responsible for a team. The next one I'm going to cover in more detail. Security is not automatic. And Claude does warn you. Skills may run code. Skills may run scripts. You are responsible for what you run and you need to treat third party skills with care to make sure that they're not malicious. Last but not least, documentation is super scattered right now. I could not even find the updated documentation on the skill file structure. I just had to discover it and tell you about it. There is this is evolving so fast that we don't have consistent documentation. So with that in mind, look at the documentation you can get from Anthropic and then also look at other excellent sources of documentation that are assembled from the web. I'm going to link to a few in my write up on the blog, but you got to trust the community on this one to help you assemble documentation. I don't think Anthropic realized how big this would be when they let it out. Okay, so those are some of the pitfalls. We've talked about the team side. We talked about version chaos. We talked about skills not triggering when you expect, forgetting to enable code execution. These are all things I have seen in practice and I just wanted to get them out of the way at the top because I don't want you to get tripped up on the value of skills and I want you to be able to do something useful with them. So with that in mind, let's jump into how you actually build a skill. Okay, here we are at the top of a tutorial on building a skill. This is a PowerPoint chunking skill. Remember how I promised to solve some of these meta problems in this video? Here's how I'm doing that. I found in practice one of the biggest issues that people had using skills is it was tough to create powerpoints using skills that did not run into Claude's context window and generate a really frustrating experience where you put all the data and you put all the narrative in and you get your fancy prompt and then you put in your Claude skill and it runs out of space. So I wanted to say is there a skill I could build that Claude could use to proactively help avoid that situation and that's what this is all about. So I my initial prompt is very simple, right? There's not magic words here. Help me build a PowerPoint chunker skill. The idea is it is invoked when a PowerPoint is asked for and it checks how big the ask is. This is actually important. I was very careful with that wording invoked when a PowerPoint is asked for because I want the skill to invoke so that any PowerPoint that's asked for gets at least a look. And so then I say, listen, I got to be honest with you. I have some other skills in my in my budget here. Are there other skills that overlap with this? And so the first thing Claus does is Claude goes and looks and says, "Well, we have a token budget adviser, which is another custom scale I built that I'm going to stick on the Substack. You have a pitch deck builder and you have a general PowerPoint builder, but Claude agrees there doesn't appear to be a general purpose chunker that triggers on any PowerPoint request." So, it understood my original prompt and it recommends chunking for large presentations. So, it does see an angle here that the three skills up here do not cover, right? There's the token budget, the pitch deck builder, and the PowerPoint. And so then it says,"I understand the challenge. Would you like me to try and build for this?" And I say, "Yep." And it just starts building, right? It reads the general PowerPoint skill to see if it has chunking logic. It takes a few seconds to look at gaps. And you can actually pop this open and it will actually give you like a lot of specifics around how it's thinking about each of these skills existing chunking logic, right? Which is super helpful. And you can dive in. I love the way Claude shows this. When you look at the three skills together, Claude says you get this state, right? like what each one does. The token and budget advisor triggers on heavy input tasks, which is what I built it to do. It can mention presentations, but it's really designed for something more, which is exactly what I built it to do. Um, and then it has the pitch deck builder, another one I built, and it triggers during the workflow once you're already in it. Um, and so that's not quite right from a chunking perspective. So Claude is taking a deep dive. And one of the things I love is that you can have Claude do so much of the lifting. I don't think people realize this. People think they have to sit down and like manually write a markdown file, and you can, but you don't have to, right? You don't have to. So, it agrees there's a gap. It has a recommendation. It offers to draft it, and it offers a sort of distinctive approach. And I say, you know what, to be honest, I think this looks good. I don't really have any concerns here. And so, it then goes and executes 11 different steps to build it. Let's just take a look at some of those 11 steps. It's going to architect the skill. It reads the skill creator tool. It creates the PowerPoint chunker skill. It looks for packaging scripts. All of this stuff it's doing in the background. And eventually it comes out with three documents. There's the skill itself with that infamous.kill extension. Don't worry, that's just azip in a disguise for Halloween, I guess. Um, it comes out with documentation because if anyone knows Claude, Claude loves documentation. Um, and it actually comes out with a bonus document about how it fits to existing skills. Uh, it then tells you what it does. It re-emphasizes my original request that it triggers on any PowerPoint request. And then it gives me the four strategies it's going to use for chunking, which I love that I get multiple strategies that will choose between. So, sequential, structure, first, etc. It explains why it's not duplicative. And here are the files. And I can look at them. I can say, "Oh, well, let me check out the readme, right?" Like, how does this actually work? Super clear readme. I can read it. I can understand. I can stick this readme somewhere so I can follow it up later. Can give me some examples. I love this. It's great. And then you might think, oh, I can then look at the zip. Well, I got to tell you, the zip is not going to render really pretty. It looks like Dingbat's font in here. Don't worry, it's still a functional skill. That is just the way the zip is rendered in. That's an example of how easy it is to create a skill because all I have to do is I just download that and then I upload that into my capabilities section and it will be right there. I'll show you. So, here I am in my capabilities section on Claude. I got there through the settings section of Claude and I went down and just clicked capabilities. here. You might not see where it is right away, but really all you have to do is scroll down, right? You just scroll down to skills, which is in preview mode. You can upload a skill here if you want. And you can also enable or disable skills with this toggle here. That works really easily. If you click the dots, you can delete. It's pretty self-explanatory. And there's our new skill, PowerPoint chunker. I just created it. Uh you can see what it does very briefly. You can expand the description so you see the full thing. And you can It's just there. It's active. and Claude will call it when the time is right. And that's it. Like, it's pretty simple. Now, you might wonder what other skills you can build that would help you with building skills. What are meta skills that are useful? Well, I have a collection here that I've put together that I'm going to share. Uh, I think the PowerPoint chunker is super useful. I think the skill security analyzer is a useful one. So this one I built because I feel like one of the gaps which I highlighted earlier in this video is that Claude does run code with this and we need some kind of security analysis. So why not use a skill to do it? I have a skill debugging assistant. So when people have trigger failures or parameter problems or prompt conflicts, how can we start to address that? Um I have a documentation generator for skills in case people forget their documentation. I have a testing framework that provides test cases for skills so that you can actually test them. I have a dependency mapper. By the way, if this starts to look a little bit like software, this goes back to one of the things I've been calling out with prompts as a whole, which I consider skills a subset of prompts. You're feeding the machine context to work for you. You got to treat it like code. You're giving the machine inputs. So, you treat prompts like code, you treat skills like code. The nice thing about skills is it has never been easier to do that for a non-technical person because here it is. It will not change on you, right? like you write the skill, you upload it, you get it, and it's just there. You don't have to remember it. And that's why I keep emphasizing this is a substantially easier way to do work and to do complex work than we did before because it makes a lot of the steady context you need something you don't have to worry about. It just sits here in skills. What I'm aiming to do with these meta skills is to take the steady context of we have to check for security, we have to debug it, we have to have a testing framework, we have to have dependency mapper. Like I'm assuming because of the response that I've seen that people are starting to build dozens and dozens of skills and they're going to need tools like this to help them track them and handle them. I even have like a performance profiler, an diagnostic tool for analyzing and optimizing skill prompts, a skill gap analyzer if you're wondering what you can use, and of course, everybody's favorite, the token budget adviser. It tells you if you are going to run out of tokens. So, my goal here is pretty simple. This is becoming a big part of the ecosystem. There are hacks that take this right away into chat GPT. Like I said, you can just upload the skill file. And so, this is not going to be limited to Claude for very long. it already isn't if you want to be adventurous. How do we start to go from what a cool toy to we can do real work with this? And I think so much of that comes down to having useful infrastructure like this that enables us to take skills seriously and actually build with them. All right, so we've done a bit of a tutorial. I'm going to give you one more peek at a really cool skill before the end of this video. But next, I want to just get into some best practices that we're starting to see emerge after the first week or so. And we've had a lot of people sort of beat on cloud skills and see what works. I think that the first thing I want to call out is in line with that idea of treating skills like code, but I want to make it accessible, right? You can decide how seriously you want to take skills. If you just want to yolo your way through and throw a skill in, it will work. If you feel like you need skills to work for serious work all the time, I would encourage you to use version numbers. I would encourage you to keep a change log. I would encourage you to store your skills in some dedicated place with a structure so that you can co go back to them and find them again. I would also encourage you to design for discoverability in your skill markdown file. Make sure that the first paragraph is super clear. Use this skill when you need to define specific tasks. Right? It takes specific inputs. It produces specific outputs. Don't use it for things you don't want it to trigger for. that that is one of the best hacks you can have because it takes away the missed trigger issue that people are having with Claude skills where the markdown starts with principles or something vague and Claude progressively reads the skill and just doesn't get to the trigger in time. The other thing that I would call out that is popping from a best practice perspective is the more you can have one workflow for all the places where you use skills, the better. So for cloud code, for the web and the desktop, for the API, have the same skill in a folder somewhere and just like copy it into the web and desktop, copy it to the right folder for code. Just make sure it's not going to be an issue where you have like similarly named skills in different versions on different surfaces. If that's going to be you, like a little organization is going to go a long way. Testing before you ship matters a lot. That's why I created a prompt uh skill to help with that. Right? there's literally a skill I'm shipping to help you with testing because I think that's something that's really annoying to do but it needs to be done and I thought why not write a skill for it. And then for the security side, I also wrote a skill to sort of assess the skills you may create for security. And it goes after standard vulnerabilities, right? Like are there issues here with uh dependencies we don't trust? Are there issues here with uh code running in ways that would perhaps not be appropriate for a clawed web app to run, etc., etc. There's a lot that goes into the security side. I would encourage you also, and this is just a small tip, but if you're in a team environment, name your skills after jobs, not teams. I know that sounds weird, but the more you can be clear about what the skill does, the more you're likely to keep track of it and use it for that purpose as opposed to naming it like the product management team skill for whatever, right? Like just drop the team names, drop your name out of it if you can, and just name the thing for what it does. And I think that's going to be useful for you. Okay, before I go farther, let me just show you a really cool skill that falls in the meta-kill category, but I don't think anyone's doing this. This is the Claude skill for continuous learning. Okay, here's the idea. I want to take this idea that I've been sort of finding across the web around continual learning as a challenge. What would it look like? And I want to turn it into a skill because no one's done that and I think it's super interesting. And so I take that as a challenge and I say within the constraints that you've got tell me how you would solve this problem and I want to make it clear right think about your current constraints don't be aspiring. Okay let me think about what's actually possible says Claude. And so Claude basically identifies that the key thing the bottleneck is manually adding any new update. But Claude could identify opportunities to create new skills autonomously within natural conversation which would be a huge plus. Claude can recognize learning moments. It can document the learning in a structured format and recommend a skill. And it's sort of gives me a sample of how this would work. Um, and then it starts to sort of get into how Claude and I would have to partner to do this because if you're going to do continual learning with an AI, you have to have a contract or agreement between you and the AI as to what you're going to learn. And so I say, "Okay, I can live with uploading this. What if we proceed to write this as a a skill? What would that look like and so it just starts to dig in, right? Um and it says, "Let's look at these sort of issues. Would we want to tackle novel problem solving, repeated patterns, domain specific?" And you notice that Claude is getting excited about this. This is going way beyond any seed of text that I found. And it's getting into how you would actually operationalize this. And so then I kind of read through and I give my opinion and I say, "This is the goal that I have. I want you to start at being able to identify 80% of tasks that hit the context window before 10% of the response tokens are used. Clause like thank you for the clear constraint. You're basically asking when you have complex challenging pieces of work, how do ident how do we identify that in a way that's useful and generate a skill opportunity something we can learn and drive? And then Claude says, "Okay, this is great." Uh, and starts to build. And long story short, I can build a continual learning capture skill and stick it into Claude, which I think is super cool. So there you go. We've gotten through two different skill tutorials here. You've seen how it works. I've given you some of the pitfalls that have caused people to trip up on Claude skills and I've given you some best practices. If we zoom out the camera lens just a minute from all of this tactical stuff. The reason why I think this matters is because Claude's skills are one of the handiest ways to extend our prompting power that I have ever seen. It is so easy now to do harder pieces of work because you can write one skill for all of the stuff that you don't want to just repeat yourself on over and over and over again. And that's why people have gotten excited about this. That's why it is worth it to dig in and learn this. And I don't want you to lose the value there just because you have to wait into some of the detail here. This is absolutely worth it. So, I hope you enjoy the Cloud Skills tutorial. If you want to go and grab all those skills I demoed, I have them over on the Substack. And honestly, have fun. Like, this is an amazing moment in AI because we all get to build these skills and talk about them and learn about them. And uh best of luck in the wild new world of cloud skills.
