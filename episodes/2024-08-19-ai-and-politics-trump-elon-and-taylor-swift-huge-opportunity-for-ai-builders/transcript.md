# AI and Politics: Trump, Elon, and Taylor Swift - Huge Opportunity for AI Builders

AI politics they are getting together whether we like it or not and I want to call out a bunch of different stories that highlight some of the trends in play number one we have an llm running for government in Wyoming so Victor Miller is the candidate on the ballot but the chat bot that he built with Chad gp4 called Vic virtual integrated citizen is what he claims is actually going to be making the decisions should he be elected now he hasn't asked open AI whether that's within their terms of use I doubt it is the Wyoming secretary of state is not amused and wants him disqualified and it is not at all clear whether he will make it to election day but I would not expect this to be the last one he's very serious about this he has a long talk um you know with with reporters when they ask him about how llms are actually better than many elected officials at reading documents and understanding their meaning and he thinks that it's going to be net net an improvement for the citizens uh in his jurisdiction if Vic is elected stay tuned on that one I'm really curious to see what happens number two over the weekend uh president Trump claimed endorsement from Taylor Swift uh using deep faked AI images uh what's interesting about that is not just that this is likely actionable under traditional defamation law but that this is likely actionable in Nashville where Taylor Swift has a residence under Nashville's new AI law so they have a specific law just for AI in Nashville because entertainment industry is so big there and this is likely going to violate that as well as some of the traditional defamation laws uh so we'll see but I would expect Taylor to sue Trump uh in the next day or two here this will be fun um and then in addition Elon over the weekend tweeted a deep faked video of kamla Harris or her voice in particular uh saying things she did not say did not label it as satire later came back and labeled it as satire so what's the takeaway here here we have these three we have someone running for office with an llm we have two deep fake issues we are getting to a point where we need to assume that AI is in the political disc course that it is generating disinformation and that therefore the overall information mix has shifted from the days of Walter kronite when we would expect that the information we got was limited but at least somewhat fact checked to a world where we should assume it actually hasn't been fact checked and it is probably false unless it is proven otherwise if you're building in the space I think one of the most interesting opportunities right now for AI is think thinking about how you can prove that something has been fact checked even large language model Architects agree that large language models don't have a factual World model they don't have a model that allows them to accept new facts at least not yet if that's the case how can we expect them to be factual in situations like this and so I think there's a huge opportunity for folks building in the space for something like the uh verified check mark that Twitter used to have that actually meant that you were verified as a celebrity it doesn't mean that anymore um it just means you can pay $4 a month maybe $8 a month anyway you want something like that for Content you want something like that for what has been produced where you can verify this has not been AI faked this is actual content by an actual person and I think there's going to be an enormous market for that and I think until that's figured out people are going to start to be willing to go back to the world that is more frictional that is more uh inperson and maybe we always were going that way but the only way right now that you can really tell that something is from a person is meeting them for coffee and talking to them like increasingly there's a lot of question even about videos now conveniently I am not an AI fake hello hello I'm sure that's what the AI fake would say as well but you get my point at the end of the day we need to start assuming that content that we see is potentially false unless it's proven otherwise until we build something in the space that solves for this and I think that is a billion dollar opportunity for someone so if you want to build in the space think about that one
