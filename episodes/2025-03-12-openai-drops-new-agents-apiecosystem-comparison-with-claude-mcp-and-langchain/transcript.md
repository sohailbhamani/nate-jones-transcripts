# OpenAI Drops New Agents API—Ecosystem Comparison with Claude MCP and LangChain

so I want to spend some time today talking about the new open aai API that dropped and how it reshapes the agent ecosystem so this is an agent focused API it's focused on helping developers who are using open AI products to build agent and multi-agent systems to do so safely to do so reliably to do so with efficient control ability so it's easy to manage these agents so far so good obviously this is not the first release in that category Claude model context protocol has been out for a bit and is doing very very well uh Lang chain is out and has been used uh for a while because it's uh essentially gives you as a developer complete control over how you want the agent to look work what underlying model you use Etc whereas open AI is obviously going to say use open Ai and I want to sort of think a little bit at the end of the first quarter here in 2025 about how this tooling stack that's starting to emerge is shaping the way we think about agents because this was supposed to be the year of agents this was supposed to be the year when businesses of all sizes and consumer applications we going to start using agents and what I've seen so far is really not in line with that expectation broadly speaking I see Enterprises being able to use Stacks like the Lang chain stack to build effective agents for commercial applications if they have strong llm expertise already if they don't then they have trouble getting those agents to work well because agent building is a separate specialty it's a complex task it's not the same as other llm engineering tasks you have to define the scope that you want your agent to engage with there's control services there's evals Etc and I am thinking that this release from open AI doesn't really change that fundamental equation I think it's basically a defensive play um and I think the timing is really interesting because conversation on Claud model context protocol and how caposio is exploding as a way to make all of those mCP servers more viable more easy to use more easy to set up that was all exploding just last week and I think open AI looked at that they looked at the advantage that Claude was starting to steal in the ecosystem by being an anchor model for a protocol that developers were adopting like crazy and they said we can't have this like we have to release something lo and behold right here's a surprise uh a surprise uh 10 a.m. press conference or whatever you want to call it the 10 a.m. podcasting from their little table and there you go they they released their their little API I I just don't see it changing much I think it's going to be helpful if you already use open Ai and you were in open AI shop I think it's not that there's anything wrong with the API it looks like a high quality API I haven't had much of a chance to play with it but there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it like it looks like a good API it's just that strategically speaking unless you are dedicated to using open AI models there's not a compelling reason to use this API and not use mCP and not or or not use Cher L graph they don't have a differentiator other than the underlying model and I think that's one of the things that ecosystem players need to think about is beyond the underlying model that they're going to have is there a differentiator in the way they've set up the ecosystem that's compelling and I think with with mCP For Better or Worse some people love it some people hate it it's the servers for Lang graph and Lang chain it's the classic approach of using open source that's by itself is a differentiator where does that leave open AI what's their differentiator it's not clear yet um and so as much as I appreciate the work that went into the API that they built and I think it's a good quality API I don't know that it really advances much strategically for open AI but we will see let me know what you think
