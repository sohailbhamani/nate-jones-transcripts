# AI's $100 Billion Dollar Week: Nvidia & Intel End 30 Year War + 7 More AI Stories

This week in AI news had everything. We had historic enemies becoming allies in a $5 billion deal. The world's most used browser got a brain transplant. We had a new open AI model. We had glasses that can read muscle signals but not Wi-Fi signals. And perhaps most interestingly, we had the first government that was willing to say we're ready for AI in a meaningful way. Let's get to the news and why it mattered. Eight stories for you. We're going to jump in with number one, Nvidia and Intel inking a new deal. The deal is worth $5 billion. Specifically, Nvidia is just investing in common stock with Intel at 23 bucks a share, which promptly popped. So, I'm sure Jensen took a few billion off to the bank on that one. But the the real reason this matters is that Intel will get access to Nvidia's technical stack, which allows them to bring Nvidia's chipsets and their firmware into the laptop supply chain and the rest of Intel's products. What that means is a lot more AI availability over the medium term for consumers and for businesses. Right now everything is running through the cloud. We have a billion people accessing AI through the cloud. I don't think that's the way it will be forever. Andre Carpathy actually called this out really effectively. I thought when he commented that we are going to see a future where everyone just has intelligence too cheap to meter that lives locally on their device and they can get other intelligence if they want it. To realize that you need a chipset change. You need a C change in what chipsets are available and this deal is the deal that unlocks that future. Intel is so ubiquitous across chipsets and consumer laptops. This deal is what enables much more powerful local LLMs to run on consumer laptops, which enables a future where you will just have a local LL running on your machine and it's local intelligence and it knows your machine really well. And yes, it can probably browse the web and do other stuff. And yes, you may call in cloud AIs as well, but it's just there to help you run your machine and run your day. The idea of a personal ondevice assistant was made real this week through this deal. Story number two, Microsoft is investing in its Wisconsin AI data center to the tune of an additional 4 billion and they are planning on bringing two data centers online there. So, there's a data center uh coming online in 2027 and another one in early 2026. And as you would expect, they're housing a ton of NVIDIA GPUs and they're basically looking to establish more compute capability for what they anticipate to be surging business demand specifically in the United States. This contradicts the narrative that was popular early in 2025 that Microsoft was scaling back its AI investments because it was feeling cautious. I don't know if you remember the brief market turmoil when Deepseek was launched, but it led to rumors circulating that Microsoft was pulling back on its AI data center investments. This investment reminds us that the long-term trajectory of investing ahead of business demand in AI remains intact. Story number three, Google Chrome got a Gemini integration and it has a bunch of features. The one that popped out to me is the idea that you can look at your email, type it into Gemini that you want to get dinner with someone and you want some ingredients and Gemini can go order from Instacart for you and get your ingredients. That stood out to me for two reasons. One, it is a classic demonstration of Aenta capability, particularly because it's tied to Instacart, which is a highly predictable interface in which you can partner with the Instacart team on to make sure you don't have mistakes. So, it's a little bit like driving on the closed course. They always tell you the stunt drivers drive on for ads. Yes, you can do this, but drive it on Instacart because that's what that's where this works. I think the reality is aentic browsers are going to feel like a gimmick until we find stable readrfaces that actually work. Now, I am the first person to say Gemini has footprint, Chrome has footprint. The fact that they felt comfortable rolling this out to the whole Chrome user base says something about how committed the team is to shipping at Google. I am sure it will get better. But init and I should add one caveat. It is rolling out to the whole world, but it's starting with US English users and global expansion will follow. So if you're in Europe, sit tight. It's coming. It integrates with calendar, YouTube, maps. That's really where the power is going to be. If you're looking down the road at what could this be, not what is this now, which I think is a great way to look at a lot of these AI stories, the trajectory for agentic browsers is how can they establish readwrite interfaces to the places that matter. Not the things that feel like made up. Because I got to tell you, when was the last time I wrote a friend and was like, let's have dinner and went to Instacart? Not very frequently, but when was the last time I went to Google Maps? All the time. When was the last time I went to YouTube? All the time. When was the last time I went to Calendar? all the time. So those kinds of concrete use cases, if they can make them feel seamless, have the potential to really build stickiness. And it's also a move that indicates that just like the rest of Google, the Chrome team is aware that they need to play catch-up here. There are smart browsers on the market that are already out there already delivering aic readr experiences. Chrome doesn't want to lose market share to those other browsers. So watch this space. I think it's going to be a really, really interesting browser war heating up here. For those of you who remember the really old browser wars in the early 2000s, this is like the 2.0 version. It's going to be really fun to watch. Next story, Notion AI launches agents. This is part of their so-called 3.0 launch where they launched the idea at the Make It With Notion event. And Notion's value proposition is very clear. They basically want to centralize all of the tool stack that goes with running a modern startup and put it into one tool. So, you don't have to worry about CRM as much. You don't have to worry about email as much. You don't have to worry about publishing a website. Everything comes in under notion. Agents make all of that easier in that product strategy because agents enable you to take the friction out of all the work you need to do. You don't need to learn Notion to do stuff in Notion anymore. If agents can create and update pages, agents can update databases. Agents can search connected tools. You get the idea. So, this features editable profile pages for customizing your agents behavior. And it enables you to store a dynamic memory or user preference. I will be really curious to see how people start to actually use this in the wild. To me, this feels like a power user feature for notion where if you're in the notion ecosystem, this is going to be a huge help. In fact, I had someone email me today and say, I am going to have to double down on my notion investment because this is going to really really help me and I can cut down on other tools, which is exactly what the notion team wants. It integrates with Slack, it integrates with email, with Google Drive, with Zenrest, with GitHub. You you get the idea. You can also plug in MCPs to it. Now, if you think about it, this is a another case where there's an arms race going on because notion is playing in a multifront battle between the sort of tool sets of the world for B2B SAS like the CRM teams, the email teams, etc. And they have like competition across all of those fronts. But they're also now at a point where they're playing with people who are using Chad GPT projects, people who are using claude projects. So the big model makers and Notion has picked the goal of being a hub which has made them a target for all of those companies. It's a really tricky place to be and it's not surprising to me that notion has seen their gross revenue uh profitability decline. I should have said that better. their gross profitability declined from a 90% profit margin to an 80% profit margin over the last year because they've had to invest so much in AI tooling to stay competitive. So watch this space. I'm really curious to see how power users actually level up with notion using AI agents. Next, Ray-B band display glasses. It was not a good launch, people. So they launched it with an aggressive price point at $799. The idea is that this is the first fully functional pair of glasses. I got to say, I've heard it before, but this one looks like the best yet, right? It has a 600 by 600 pixel fullcolor display. It refreshes at 90 Hz. It is bright enough that it looks like you can read it in daylight, but it does not have light leakage, so other people can't see what you're seeing. And it looks like it's small enough that it doesn't look weird to wear. The drawback, as we all saw on the demo, is that it is a little bit sensitive. And so it seems like the team had some Wi-Fi issues in the room at the time. They're trying to say that this was all a function of dev servers and the Wi-Fi. My view is we will see how reliable the AI is. Once we get people out in the wild who are able to wear this and actually interact while they're at the park or, you know, while they're taking the kids for a walk. My suspicion is that some of the issues that came up in the demo are actually not just Wi-Fi issues. It sounded to me when I watched the demo like the AI actually heard queries and got mixed up. Put a pin in this one. There's an ongoing debate, ongoing battle between Apple and Meta over who is going to be able to convince people to get into wearables for glasses. Nobody has really gotten something that everybody's wearing on the street yet. And that is the bar, right? That is the iPhone bar. And I think that to get there, you have to make something that feels not just unobtrusive, but actively cool. And that was the bar that the iPhone was able to cross to drive adoption. And that's something that I know Meta wants to get to with their partnership with Rayban. I don't know that they got there with this one, but they probably got closer than anyone has before. Next, we have OpenAI's GPT5 codeex release. This is the new model from GPT5 from the the OpenAI family. This model is designed specifically to help with the nonlinearity of coding tasks and it follows the ongoing trajectory of the codeex team. It's shipping really, really quickly. One of the things I've been most impressed by is how quickly the codeex team has been shipping. So much of what you buy in AI is not the capability today. It is the trajectory of the team building the product. And Codeex has been outshipping cloud code lately. I noticed that a lot of claude's recent releases in the last few weeks have been productivity tool oriented but not cloud code oriented. And Codex has been catching up and according to some developers surpassing cloud code. Now my view is that it is a little bit like apples and oranges and it's going to depend on your developer use case what matters. Codeex seems to be positioned more for larger teams that have more PRs hitting GitHub at the same time and you need something to sort of pre-review. But on the other hand, Anthropic claims that's what their cloud code does internally. And so I don't think it's that cloud code can't do that. It's just that there are people who have got stacks that are oriented around cloud code, which certainly can scale from the individual terminal on up. And then there are folks who are used to the GPT ecosystem and they just want Chad GPT all the way down. To me, it is almost feeling like the Windows versus Mac wars of the '9s where people have a brand affiliation and that drives a lot of the downstream product choices. Anyway, from a capability perspective, this new GPT5 codeex model adjusts thinking time based on task complexity, which makes it much much more efficient, up to 94% more efficient on simple tasks while allocating a ton more tokens to very complex reasoning tasks. What that means to me is that they got better at parsing prompts, which is a huge deal. The other thing to notice about GPT5 codecs is that this is the model that later won a collegiate coding competition with a top score better than the best human in the competition, which is a new watermark for AI because previous high water marks for AI, AI has been slightly below or equal to the best humans in a particular technical competition. As far as I know, this is the first time an LLM has been better than a human unambiguously at a top technical competition. So, I am really curious to see where we go from here. Couple more stories for you to round out our day. OpenAI and Microsoft finally cut a deal. If you recall, they've been debating back and forth about their previous deal that they made and there have been questions around the equity stake that would be taken. And there have been questions around that definition of AGI clause that was famously there where OpenAI could void a lot of the terms with Microsoft if they declared AGI. Fundamentally, what was going on is that Open AI had grown up and Microsoft needed to readjust their relationship with Open AI. Well, they have now. uh the nonprofit arm of OpenAI, I you I can't believe they're still a nonprofit, but that's a separate story, received a hundred billion dollar equity stake in the for-profit OpenAI company as part of a comprehensive reorganization that Microsoft approved. Open AAI will then share only 8% of its revenue with Microsoft and other commercial partners by 2030, down from the current 20. So essentially, Open AI successfully made the case to Microsoft that they'd grown up enough, that they'd scaled the business enough, that 8% of their projected revenue through 2030 was bigger than 20% would have been when they were at a smaller scale and a smaller run rate. What that says is that everybody in the room making that deal thinks the demand picture for AI over the next 5 years is even bigger than they thought a couple of years ago to the point where they are willing to take significant dilution on revenue share. Last story, Ireland EU AI act. It might sound boring, but it's not. Ireland designated 15 different authorities to enforce the EU AI Act, including their central bank, a data protection commission, a health products regulatory agency. And they established a single point of contact within the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to coordinate with EU bodies, member states, stakeholders, etc. You care about this because they're actually putting in place the regulatory environment and framework to enforce the EU AI act. This is going to create a national AI office in Ireland by August 2nd of 2026, which will centralize coordination, host regulatory sandboxes, drive AI innovation, etc. This will enable controlled AI testing under compliance safeguards inside the EU, which I know EU entrepreneurs are excited about because one of the things they've sort of complained about is that the new EU AI act is going to hamper European AI innovation. Other companies like American companies care about this because they are doiciled in Ireland. And so where Ireland goes, there goes the headquarters of many of the most prominent US mega corps. There are a number that have offices there. Amazon has offices there. Apple has offices there. And there are others as well. You want to be paying attention to this because the EU 500 million member market is probably the second biggest market for US AI companies after the US itself. With the divergence with China in terms of both chipsets where China is saying no to Nvidia chipsets now and now also sort of a divergence around purchasing patterns and consumer patterns and the divergence in internet behavior. US technology companies selling AI are not going to get very far in China right now. There are too many open source models. It's a different ecosystem, but they will have a chance to market in the EU. And conversely, EU companies that come up and are able to use this regulatory authority sandbox get better. Maybe Mistl comes to mind are going to have an option to bring a compliance first perspective with AI to the US if they want. And it's it's still valuable to have a compliance first perspective in the US. There are a lot of highly regulated industries in the US where AI is being slowwalked because no one can explain how to do it safely. Healthcare comes to mind. How do you make sure that you roll out across the gigantic healthcare industry HIPPA compliant AI workflows? There's a whole forest of US startups on that, but there's no reason why EU startups can't compete there, too. So, that's the stories for the week. It's been a busy week. We will see what next week's holds. Cheers.
