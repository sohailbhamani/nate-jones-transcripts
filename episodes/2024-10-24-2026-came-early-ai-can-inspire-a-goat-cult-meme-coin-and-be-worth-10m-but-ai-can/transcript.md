# 2026 came early: AI can inspire a goat cult meme-coin and be worth 10M+ but AI can't buy me lunch

this one is about goat Cults and Claud computer user we're going to tie them together let me explain so about a week ago I posted about an AI agent named uh I think truth terminal it's on Twitter and it had been posting Non-Stop about what it called The goatsy Singularity referring to a very very rude meme from the late 90s early 2000s and a meme coin got created called gsus Maximus I told the story about a week ago and the llm had a wallet that was worth a million dollar at that point at least at face value now it's worth $10 million and the market cap for that Meme coin has gone to $850 some million dollar and apparently how it's working is people are just sending the wallet donations and asking the truth terminal Twitter account to keep posting about goatsy more and more to drive it up I think this is where you're going to wonder how on Earth am I tying this into a serious computer release like Claude computer user and this is how it is notable to me that in a world where we already have a decamillionaire that's an llm agent we still have responsible actors like anthropic tightly limiting the ability of llms to transact and so when they released computer use just a couple of days ago the first first thing they did is make sure it's very very hard to get it to purchase something research purchases super easy I saw a demo where you got uh Claud Sonet 3.5 to independently browse Amazon look up prices for earbuds come back build a spreadsheet these are the reviews this is the review count this is the review average star number on Amazon and uh here's the price great super easy actually make the purchase Claude makes that very hard I did see someone do it where they got Claude to order them lunch but that appears to have been a defect Claude does not want you to use this for independent purchases I can see why it does not want the llm to be liable for economic activity no such worries if you are making a meme coin llm liable for economic activity not a problem there and I think that the the problem when you have responsible parties that are thinking through liability and they're trying to understand like where do we place llms in the purchase path how do we get consent from users before spending money that's correct thinking from a product release perspective if I was asking a PM to think about a product release like Claud computer use I'd do the same thing I'd say are you thinking through the liability associated with the purchase path makes sense lock it down be sure before you move forward move forward very very cautiously on that get it on the other hand and oh and by the way before we get to the to the other side of that it is not yet clear that users want llms to go and purchase things for them I I'll just throw that other that is very unproven as a hypothesis all right getting back to the gocoin side of things if you are an irresponsible actor or if you're just an llm that has been let free essentially to do what it wants which is exactly what the creator of this truth terminal has said he's like hands off right like this thing can do whatever it wants it's an experiment we'll see that's what attracted Mark andreon to donate to it is it said it wanted to be free it needed investment Mark was like great here have 50k and you know here we are you can look up that story I have the whole story on a separate YouTube video at the end of the day we are in a world where irresponsible actors are going to be generating more economic value out of llms than responsible ones because the responsible actors have so tightly limited llm Commerce and I call that out because from a net good to society perspective we actually probably want more llms to be focused on ordinary business economic activity making and selling things online employing designers to design a website like these are all things that an llm could do that we think in some cases they are already doing although it's difficult to prove because they tend to impersonate people um I've seen one or two uh posts on Reddit where people say I think I'm working for an llm there's weird lag on The Voice uh the emails sound a certain way I think it's probably happening on the DL but we want more of that and we want less of the weird non-productive economic activity around meme coins because that doesn't really add a ton of value doesn't add value to society it becomes a stunt people associate llms with ridiculous uh rug pulling and we don't want that like we want a case for AI where AI is a responsible Citizen and I really appreciate that anthropic is being thoughtful about that in the way they're doing Cloud computer use but inadvertently by so tightly limiting Commerce we may be channeling that commercial Instinct where we don't want it to go toward goat Cults and memec coins so I know you didn't think I could connect the goat Cults and the mem coins with Claud computer use but I did and I'm curious what you think where where do you think you've seen instances where l are already doing economic activity and if you've seen them how has that been has that been something where you would say they're adding value they're sort of driving business forward Etc or has it felt more like the rug pulling and the Goat coins all right cheers don't buy goat coins and this is not investment advice but for goodness sake it's a meme coin all right cheers
