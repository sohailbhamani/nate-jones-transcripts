# OpenAI raised 6.6B and it's not close to enough cash

Sam mman raised the biggest Venture Capital round in history yesterday I don't think it's big enough so 6.6 billion dollar tiger Global's in there uh Nvidia is in there coal Ventures is uh in on the round Microsoft is in on the round which doesn't surprise anybody and Sam was able to persuade the investors to not touch some of the other companies that are draining talent in the field which is a nice get for him so Ilia and safe super intelligence can invest xai and Elon can't invest en thropic can't invest you get the picture this is a really odd raise already but the thing that I think is most interesting is not the fact that this is technically an investment in a nonprofit that is going to go through convertible notes to get to a for-profit entity and eventually give Sam Equity that's weird and that's going to require Sam and his lawyers to do a lot of work but they have the money for the lawyers now no that's not the really odd thing nor is it odd that open AI is losing five billion do on revenue of 3.6 and expects to get to like 11 and change billion next year very typical VC unit economics there slightly bigger slightly more dramatic but like not an unusual pattern no the weird thing is they're putting all this money down and it's not remotely close to enough for artificial general intelligence not close like if you look at the amount of power needed to consume across data centers in the US or elsewhere to make a run at general intelligence and the public statements that Microsoft and openai have made about how big their Ambitions are five gws two gws three gws of power whatever and how many data centers that they want to run like half a dozen six or seven I think was leaked by Sam uh in a proposal to the USG and these are massive data centers like individually gigawatt scale data centers they're talking hundreds of billions of dollars maybe hundred billion dollars um and you have to buy the chips for that you have to build the physical plant for that and this is a race right like you can't not be ahead if you're open AI they have the pressure of the leader on their backs and so they have to break ground on that next year which means they have to start paying bills on that next year they're already burning five billion they got a $6.6 billion raise to help plug the whole on existing burn rate they're about to turn their burn rate on times 20 where is that money going to come from I don't know I don't think Sam quite knows yet Sam is in the middle of fundraising and we will see but my bet is since he's very good at fundraising and since these massive Venture players are already in the ring with their money with open AI they are highly incentivized both to put more money in for general intelligence and also to get other big players Sovereign wealth funds maybe Black Rock I don't know um and and and I say Black Rock by the way not because I know anything but because like they're one of the few players that actually has money to deploy at scale most Venture funds probably can't afford to Pony up the kind of massive single bet that you would need for AGI even to be a part in a hundred billion dollar round so it's all speculation but if you do the math between the public statements that Sam has made and that Microsoft has made about how big their Ambitions are and you compare that to the amount of money they actually raised at what is to date the biggest round in VC history it doesn't add up it's like $95 billion short got to come from somewhere it's not just going to come out of thin air um and I don't know where it's going to come from but if they want to keep on track with their AGI Ambitions they are going to have to get that money in the next six to eight months so stay tuned this is the biggest round in Venture Capital so far and I emphasize so far um yeah let me know what do you think about the Rays what do you think I missed do you think there's going to be a bigger round coming cheers
