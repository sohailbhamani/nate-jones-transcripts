# From 1T Tokens to ZB Scale—How to move past the internet and scale LLMs

so this past fall at the nurp conference Ilia suver said that we are in a world that has data as oil we are in a world where data is running out and that that phrase has been haunting me ever since I want to suggest a pathway to more data right now large language models can get trained on something like a trillion tokens of very curated text it's not the whole internet I mean you can start with the whole internet but it's not like clean curated text there's problems though that's a static snapshot the internet continues to grow there's also of course larger training uh sets of private data that are generated all the time so I asked myself what kinds of breakthroughs are needed to lead to useful data not total data but useful data for large language models basically what is the scaling framework to move from a trillion tokens up past 10 trillion tokens and Beyond the this is what I want to talk about today if we scale to 10 trillion tokens in our training data set we're going to need to do multilingual we're going to need to do um very focused curated expansion of historically underrepresented texts we have to go beyond our English focused Text corpus or body for these llms to a much more multinational one it has to be not 80% or 90% English but like 30 40% English lot of Chinese lot of Hind Hindi a lot of French a lot of Spanish it has to more represent the world's actual language set we also need much better curation tools we'll need to automate cleaning we have to have better duplication pipelines that handle diverse languages and formats we have to have more flexible tokenizers that adapt to morphological differences across languages and if we can get there models are going to become much more truly multilingual and they'll capture a broader range of our expression I will say someone who knows Indonesian that the model doesn't feel as natural in Indonesian as it does in English and that would make sense because Chad GPT and other models are mostly trained on English data and so to me the simplest path to 10 trillion tokens is actually making the training set truly reflective of the languages that we speak as a global Community let's go a step further what's the path to 100 trillion tokens in our training sets that are high quality I think video is obviously your real-time web streams continuous ingestion of high quality web content social media streams getting large scale transcription going of good quality podcasts of phone calls obviously with permission if they're high quality um and multimodal as well like getting Vision involved where we have high quality Vision tokens those are all pieces we have to Cobble together to make the jump from 10 trillion to 100 trillion tokens it's going to require an immense amount of compute a lot of storage huge network capacity it's going to dwarf anything we've got today um and it's going to take Transformers that can absolutely unify text images and even videos in the same architecture we are just now getting to truly native multimodal architectures for text and images I know text and images and video are on the horizon at open AI but it needs to be scalable and if we're at 100 trillion tokens and we have continuous feeds it means that it opens the possibility of continuously updated models that stay current on world events don't ask me quite how we architect that I think that's look that's two or three jumps beyond what we have now it's okay to dream a little bit I'm mostly trying to color in roughly what it would take from a tokenization perspective to get there let's go beyond what's past 100 trillion tokens if we get into the quadrillion space for tokens or 10 to the 15th power we're talking pulling in sensor logs this is where robotics starts to come into play I know a lot of folks have been very excited about robotics getting into the physical space because embodied experience should dramatically expand our healthy token input selection for llms so sensor logs from cameras lar tactile sensors motor commands internet of things and where Ables and being able to pull all of that in again and actually train it as a good quality token so that we can actually train understand embody that understanding and output it would take even bigger GPU and TPU clusters it would take systems that can learn from interactions and unlabeled sensor streams it would take tools that can compress raw Visual and audio frames into tokens that are semantically meaningful and they would have to do all of this at an unheard of scale so again that's yet another set of technical challenge we' challenges we'd have to overcome and then if we want to go even farther get into zettabytes like 10 to the 20th tokens and Beyond now we have to look at three-dimensional scans we have to look at full audio streams simulation logs Internet of Things sensor data at City scale um data across multiple Industries in real time in standardized formats healthc care manufacturing agriculture autonomous vehicles um our infrastructure has to handle tens to hundreds of zettabytes we need to have modular architectures that can handle multi-trillion parameter scales um it's just it's an absolutely mindboggling task so there in just a few minutes I've taken you from where we're at now with trillion token models up to 10 trillion tokens up to 100 trillion tokens up to quadrillion and then to the zetabyte era I don't know when we'll get there and one of the interesting things is I don't know if we have to get there for artificial general intelligence that's meaningful if you think about it it is notable to me that clairo was saying that uh product requirements documents are actually higher quality in general without reasoning models in other words the stuff we have right now the models we have today the four class models we use good enough for that piece of work that doesn't mean I'm under the illusion that we have good enough models for everything else and all general purpose work obviously not we have other things to do but I don't think it's eminently clear that we need to get to zetabyte scale in order to have general intelligence or even to unlock Super intelligence and start to kick off a chain reaction of intelligence that's self-improving we may be able to get there sooner one of the reasons we may be able to get there sooner is the reasoning scale model which doesn't even touch any of this you can scale reasoning by scaling compute at test time obviously regardless of the training data set size and so imagine having a much much smarter trained model at the 10 trillion or 100 trillion token scale and also layering reasoning on top of that as a second scaling law and so when I think about sort of the path to the next few years I think it makes a lot of sense to be really honest about some of these big Lego blocks that are steps along the pathway to artificial intelligence scale we need to be honest that we have barely scratched the surface of high quality tokens but at the same time getting 10x 100x 1,000x and more high quality tokens is going to be very very difficult it's going to be difficult from a uh research perspective just understanding how to do it at scale it's going to be difficult from a industrial data management perspective building the data centers ingesting the data cleaning the data at scale that we've never touched before Etc it's going to be difficult from the perspective of serving these models because they're absolutely huge models to serve um and we have that sort of crosscutting factor of reasoning where model makers will have to decide how big do these models need to be in order to be useful to do economic work especially if you can use reasoning as a sort of cheat code to scale up this is what was on SAA nadella's mind when he was talking about the value of being a renter in the Gold Rush he was talking about Azure and how he wants to rent data centers to people who are interested in models in model making and implicitly was saying he was kind of out of the model making business as just a Microsoft Project I think he was seeing the immense data costs here and he was like you know what I'd rather just just rent these guys all the data centers they need that's a money-making proposition because if you think about it this is an immense amount of effort scaling up data like this and the value you get is something that you have to continue to accelerate in order to harvest open AI is right now writing the tiger's tail they have gotten a little lead through 01 and 03 and they need to continue to hold on to that lead in order to continue to make the case demonetize for Enterprise so they are they are locked into the poker betting cycle for model makers they can't get out and I think Sacha looked at that and was like that's a very expensive game to get in you can put all of this investment in and then you have to be locked in to keep doing more and more investing farther and farther because right behind you were people like deep seek who are relentlessly distilling models down and people like quen who are distilling deep seek models and I think there was another Chinese model today that distilled even further now you have tiny tiny models like billion perometer models or less that are really really good um and those are only possible because the original training work that was done on the four class models but the fact that you can train once and then distill across the world means that you only can harvest the value of these models if you keep maintaining your Edge if you keep growing and growing and growing and maintaining your Edge no matter matter what and so when I look at this token uh ladder up from a trillion tokens where we are now to the zetabyte era what I think of is opening eyes kind of locked into this arms race anthropic has locked into this arms race Gemini is pretty locked into this arms race arguably meta is locked into this arms race and whether they like it or not I think some of the Chinese llm uh model makers are locked in as well they all need to get to the Winner's Circle and they don't know how to define that and they only know they have to keep climbing and that's very good for consumers and that's very good for Builders but there's immense technical challenges coming up here and I'll be really curious to see how they balance the challenge of getting into these new high quality tokens versus reasoning one more thought I'll leave you with this entire ladder is very friendly to Nvidia is friendly in terms of gpus it's friendly in terms of the wearables and the lar and the robotics that has to happen for some of the later stages with sensors you're not going to get robotics at scale I think without some kind of Invidia stack underneath um and I might be wrong maybe there'll be another company that will come along that will be able to scale up uh gpus and scale up sort of sensor collection but my my gut says Nvidia is already here with their big robotics push at the beginning of this year and they intend to relentlessly build into this space the way they've relentlessly built into a bunch of other spaces in the past so we'll see anyway some late night thinking on where we're at with data I just I don't want to sit there and say that data is oil and we can't go get more I want to think about the world in terms of tokenization and I want to get more creative so you tell me
