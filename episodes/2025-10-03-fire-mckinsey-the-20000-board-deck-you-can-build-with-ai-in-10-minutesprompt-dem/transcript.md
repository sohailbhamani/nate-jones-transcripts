# FIRE McKinsey: The $20,000 Board Deck You Can Build with AI in 10 Minutes—Prompt Demo!

I solved AI for PowerPoint and I'm going to show you how to solve it for you and your organization, too. And we're not going to take very long to do it. It's going to be like 10, 15 minutes max. So, dig in. I am going to go through the problem and why it's a big deal. I'm going to show you the principles I use to prompt. Well, five of them. And then I'm going to show you a bad example. You guys have always wanted to see a bad prompt by Nate. You're going to see one of my bad prompts, one of the ones that did not make it to my Substack post, right? Like, that's too terrible. We're not going to do it. And then I'm going to show you how I fixed it. I'm going to show you how I fixed it and made it good. Because the larger lesson for PowerPoint is that unlike producing text, unlike producing numbers in Excel, now PowerPoint is really finicky with AI, but it is production ready if you know how to think in systems. And so the challenge, and this is for everybody, right? I looked it up about 1ifth of our working time as knowledge workers is in PowerPoint. So, you know, take a day out of your week. That's PowerPoint. And apparently about 40% of that day, so half the day is just design. I'm terrible at PowerPoint design. Are you bad? I'm bad at it. And so, we are talking about lifting a tremendous amount of work. If you have a 10-person company, how much are you saving every week if you're not doing PowerPoints? Now I will tell you most 10person companies try to do as few powerpoints as possible but the big companies the thousand person companies the 50,000 person companies which I have worked at they do a lot of decks that is where those hours go they can be so much more productive so let's get into it what are the five principles that I discovered through bad prompting to get to better prompting that actually shape how you do PowerPoint in 2025 with AI. Okay, number one, if you want to generate enterprisegrade PowerPoint decks with AI, you must think about workflow enforcement. And that sounds like a super technical term, and it is a little bit technical, but not scary technical. You need to tell AI which technical tools it should call to consistently create clean PowerPoint files. Right now in October of 2025, if you are prompting Claude, which is far and away the best at creating PowerPoint files right now, you want to tell it to use the HTML to PPTX skill. I am not making that up. I wish it was not that hacky, but it has multiple tools to call from. I have seen it admit to me that it did not use HTML 2 PPTX and that that is why it could not figure out how to measure pixel pixel overhang correctly and then I've seen it use it and it works. So it's not just hallucinating that explanation. So the larger principle here like let's go by beyond like let's say next week somebody else releases a great PowerPoint model. What's the takeaway for for everybody regardless of the model you're on? AI needs those workflow constraints because it is executing specialized spatial outputs. So make sure that you take the time in your AI, maybe it's chat GPT, maybe it's copilot, figure out what tools it is calling and make sure that you enforce the tools that are best for that particular workflow because and this is a larger insight. This is not just for PowerPoint. Any AI system I have used has the tendency to silently degrade tool calls and not tell you. And the reason why is they're trained to be helpful. And if something goes wrong and they forget the skill or they can't call the skill reliably or there's some kind of connection error to invoking something in the cloud for that skill, they will just go to the next best thing, never tell you, and do their best to make it work. You have to be intentional at discovering what skills work, how those skills work, and then think carefully about the prompts you construct to insist on workflow enforcement. If this sounds like systems thinking, I warned you it is, but I'm doing a lot of the work for you on the prompt creation here. And I want to remind you that this is systems thinking once to save you boatloads of time down the way. Principle number two, simple visual rules scale. This is I feel like this is going back to Apple or something, but clean typography and spacing produces much more reliable results. This has profound implications for a lot of existing corporate decks because a lot of existing corporate decks depend on over decoration and call it branding. I've got news for you. One, that's not real branding. And two, it does not play well with AI. And the organizations that use AI to ship PowerPoint with clear thinking are going to run circles around you. It is worth redesigning your decks for cleaner typography and cleaner spacing in order to allow AI to help you create these decks. If you want to add fancy borders, if you want to add containers, it just creates brittleleness. It just creates brittleleness. And simple does not have to mean ugly as you will see later in this video. And so think in constraints. The principle is that constraintbased design beats decorative specification. And that's going to be true of any model you use. It's true of claude. It's true of Chad GPT. The the challenge for these models is that PowerPoint is both a visual medium and also a medium for expressing complex analyses. They have to do both. Keep the visual medium really clean, and you're going to allow them to express the thinking they've done very well. Principle number three, multi- chat architecture enables complicated narratives and complex narratives, sophisticated narratives. Pick your adjective. Board decks can be 40 slides, right? If you separate planning from execution, you can build 30 plus slide decks with coherent narrative arcs using AI vastly faster than you did before. It is not the whole team for a week getting ready for the big presentation. It is one person working through it for like two or three hours getting the deck put together. The architect chat can create the blueprint and then generator chats will build chunks and an assembly chat will ensure consistency. This will scale. And yes, I put the prompts together for this once I figured it out. Why can't we do it all at once? Because unlike some of the complicated Excel prompts that I've played with, the visual element seems to consume tokens. I find that the context window gets eaten much much faster with PowerPoint than with text or with Excel. And so I have to plan for that and I have to deliberately chunk my work right now. That may change, but for now that's true. But this still unlocks tremendous value. We're talking board ready decks in hours, not days or weeks. And the strategic planning presentation, you have more time to resolve the stakeholder conflicts and all of that and the people stuff and then put it into the deck. it is systematically possible to generate multiple iterations in like a tenth of the time it previously took. And so that's going to enable you to make faster progress through what is effectively an organizational conflict that you're negotiating. Because I got to be honest with you, most of the time you have a complex narrative, you've got organizational conflict and you need to negotiate it. It's the human element you want to focus on. And so really all this is doing is it's freeing you to do that. It's freeing you to focus on the people. Principle number four, iterative prompts are going to build faster. And so I one of the things I came up with as I was kind of working through this is that it's important to be able to establish a base template plus data plus some logic for synthesizing that data and then add the style requirements. Essentially I am challenging the AI in the prompt to go through those steps. So, first figure out the base template, figure out your data, synthesize it, and then finally add the style and do it in a way that's clean and validate each step along the way. Iteratively work because you want to be reliable. And so on larger tasks, those can look like separate prompts. Let's architect the base template. Great. Let's add the data in. Let's just look at the raw outline. Great. Now, let's make sure that we synthesize it so that the we're emphasizing the right points. Great. Now, we're going to add the style. Now, on smaller decks, on like four or five slide decks, you can do that all in one go. If it's a bigger one, you're going to be looking at chunking. But the principle is that incremental validation, having those checkpoints is going to beat comprehensive specs. And so, one of the things I've learned is that you can write in those validation checks and then even if you are sending a fairly large prompt, you can instruct the more sophisticated frontier models now to conduct validation along the way. and fail the check and rewrite if it doesn't work. I have literally seen Claw do this where it will check to see if it's meeting my outline requirements, fail itself, go back and fix it, and I'm just sitting here like, you know, drinking coffee, watching it work. It's phenomenal. You can have it selfiterate. Principle five, you want to think about how prompts tell AI to reconcile conflicts. This is a larger thing. Data processing logic is one of the great constraints on AI across enterprise. I should probably write more about that. If you can get data processing logic cleaned up so you have ambiguityfree data, you are going to enable much higher quality synthesis. So don't just say format this C CSV file into a PowerPoint and present it. Say reconcile these three conflicting financial projections and explain your methodology if you don't know what the answer is. If you do know what the answer is, say this is the way I want you to resolve this conflict in the data. I know it's there. And so in a sense, powerpoints are the result of narratives of conflict over data. And what you are doing is you are exposing the data processing logic that you always needed to do, but it was in your head. And now you have to express your intent clearly and get it into PowerPoint. So what does this mean for teams? This means you can now systematically generate enterprise PowerPoint decks. Full stop. Not maybe with the right prompt. So it's reliably at scale you can generate enterprise PowerPoint decks with quality that pass executive review. Now are you going to have to collect your data? Yes. Are you going to have to prompt well? Yes, we'll get into that. Are you going to have to make sure that you are systematic in your thinking? I just went through that. All of those things are true. But this changes the economics of workloads for entire companies. Status reports can be automated. You can have sales decks that are templ templatized with AI customization. You can have board updates that really you're just obsessed with the right message for the people and you don't have to think about how you get that message into PowerPoint. It's just done. And you in fact have time to take in multiple AI perspectives. Think about them. Think if they're correct, refine the deck, iterate on the deck in ways that you never had before. And you also have the ability to generate decks on the fly, which has always been a struggle for people. I want this deck by tomorrow. Well, now I'm staying up all night. Right? Anyone who has worked in business has had that moment. We don't want that. You don't have to stay up all night anymore. And so the new workflow is that you can give the deck what it wants as long as you own the data and the narrative requirements and can communicate that clearly. And then AI can just generate the deck for you and you're off to the races. And so what took three or four days can now take an hour. It's that fast, maybe less if you have the data. Probably 20 minutes. And so my suggestion for you is that we think about the outcomes we're driving and the data and business logic that drive those outcomes and then we build in between them the prompt intents that allow us to automate those outcomes. All of my principles come down to that. And if that sounds a little bit abstract, let me make it more specific. I'm going to show you now a bad I'm going to show you what I promised the result of a bad prompt. And I'm going to explain why it was bad. And then I'm going to get to a good prompt and explain how it worked for a good power. All righty. This is the bad one. Are you braced? You might think, "Wow, this is not too bad." It's bad. I would never put this in front of someone. Let me explain why. I want you to look here. That 1.2 million addresses customerf facing systems. I don't care about the text. It is somehow underneath this object. It's basically stacked these box objects stuck text on top. The text is sliding under the box underneath. This whole slide is completely unreadable. I don't care if it's an emergency board review. I'm not reading it. This is also sliding out. Are you starting to see the pattern? It looks like the model is struggling with outlines. I thought that, too. We'll get into that. Over here, you see that you you think that it might be good at sort of increasing the size of the font. No, it's terrible at it. That did not work. And I looked at that and I was like, I've seen it do that well. I wonder why it's really struggling. I noticed that's in the box. Again, you also notice the amount of text here. Look at this. It's got scenario one. It's got two lines of text. If you look through, this is like 10 lines of text here. This is another eight lines of text. This pie chart, where's the I can't read the numbers. It's black on black. There's clearly a contrast issue here. Like, that's a disaster. This is completely unreadable in tiny font. The bar charts aren't easy to read either. And at the end of the day, like it it hides the executive recommendation in this little box and it's hard to even read it. And so even though I think as I look at it that the content is probably good because I prepared a data packet. This matches the data packet, I don't think it's wrong to say that there's $480,000 in loss deal value because that was in the data packet. I think it's getting that right. What this reads to me like is a prompt that did not handle the visual element correctly and that probably overpacked the instructions. So with that in mind, let's go back up and see what we got for the prompt. By the way, look at how much work it does. You see all this work? Look at all this work it's doing. Okay, let's go back up. Let's check the prompt that I sent. Okay. Wow. This looks like a Nate prompt. It's so complicated. They're not all good, guys. So, I give it all of the input specs here. I give it the validation requirements, but you'll notice the validation requirements at this stage aren't visual. This is all about data. That might be a mistake. I give it the data synthesis challenge. Again, it's all about data and getting it right. You'll notice I am doing best practice in specifying this output structure. I'm giving it a slide outline here. And then creative constraints. So this is where things might have gone wrong. The deck must feel like a McKenzie crisis consulting but maintain startup urgency. That seems like overworthiness. And I'm I I would be getting headaches if I were the LLM. Uh narrative arc frame as controlled crisis with a clear path forward. I guess that's fine. Nothing visual here, by the way. It says creative constraints, but this is all about story. You'll notice that. And then it gives you failure conditions, generic slides, missing synthesis, charts without clear decision implications. Do you see how as you read through this, the LLM could have passed every validation step in this prompt and used all of the files I gave it above and still created the deck we saw. That's right. We did not do a good job explaining how to deal with the 40 50% of our work that is visual storytelling in PowerPoint. That is a miss on this prompt. Now, let's see how I fixed it. Okay, here we are. Immediately, it looks better. I can read this. I'm not going nuts with what looks like ambulance sirens. The numbers make sense. They're highlighted appropriately. I guess green is good and red is bad. I don't know. But at least I can read it really well. Uh, and I go through, I see narrative. This works. Is it a simpler slide? Yes. Does it have no design? Actually, that's not true. It very intentionally has a color palette to it. You can actually see these subtle gray outlines are now working. Uh so you I don't know if you can see, but like these three each have subtle gray outlines around them that work well. Uh this has a color block that works well. Also, the graphs have good contrast unlike last time. We're not messing around with like black on black. Um, and I think I had a black on navy blue at one point. Like there was some real bad inaccessible color contrast. So it looks better. It still looks thoughtful. It's much easier to read. And actually, I would argue it's a better communication tool. So now let's go back up and ask ourselves, what did we do differently? How did the prompt change? First of all, you notice it's now validating a bunch of things that we would call visual. So it's not color blocking. It's got high contrast. It's validating typography hierarchy. I bet you can guess what's going to happen. It's going, "Oh, I love this. I love this because it shows us how good it is at testing. It is actually measuring how good the layout is in detail." So, it keeps doing that. These prompts are long. This is why it eats the context window. You're seeing all of this work it's doing. Go back up now. Let's look at the prompt. So the prompt is much shorter. It's so short it now fits inside the text window and this helps the system to understand better what we're doing. So first things first, we are now specifying the HTML 2 PPTX workflow. Debug installation issues do not switch because we've observed that works better with the PowerPoint skill. Again, if you were using chat GPT, if you were using Copilot, you need to figure out the skills that they are using by talking to the system and then start to insist on the ones that work better. So, we're insisting on the skill. We are insisting on no border boxes around text elements because that was one of the things that we noticed failed. No outline shapes, no rounded rectangles because that was one of the issues. Use clean typography, spacing, and subtle color blocks. I will say I have seen rounded rectangles work sometimes. This was a little bit overconervative. We specify where text should sit and then we start to think it through. Please describe the clean layout approach without border elements, the color palette, the typography, the visual emphasis, and we'll go down and see how it does this. And then generate the deck. Here's your inputs. By the way, this is a subtle thing. I list three inputs here. I gave it six. I'm over I'm overshotting the context to stress it out on purpose for this test and I think it passed. Then do the layout. You see how we are actually acknowledging what we humans have to do as work. We are acknowledging how hard it is to do PowerPoint and giving the system some help here. If you are wondering, well, how do I get my particular brand into AI PowerPoint? I actually wrote a prompt for that. But the the TLDDR is you have to give it a slide and tell it to extract the style from the slide. All right. Then we go into the slides and what each has what we're looking for. We're very specific. Then we go into validation gates. So please show me a thumbnail. Please verify contrast ratios. This is the access accessibility piece. Assume test text readability at different zoom levels. So test that. And the failure conditions now include visual stuff as well. Let's see how it actually complied. So we saw some of the work, but here now we have a design plan. It's going to give us a layout. It's going to give us specific colors. And by the way, you can actually pull those colors and check them if you want. It's going to give you visual emphasis without borders like we asked. Chart styling. It's going to deal with accessibility. And now it's going to start implementing. I didn't have to tell it to go. It just kept going here, right? And now it's going to start building. It's going to start using JavaScript to convert the HTML slides to PowerPoint. Work, work, work, work, work. And it has to keep going. Like one of the things that I am realizing is that part of why we humans have to do this so much. Why we spend arguably half a day a week just on PowerPoint design as a society in our work weeks is because of how hard this is. And this is showing me that AI finds it hard to it is basically brute forcing this. This is hard work for for AI as well. And the fact that we can actually get to this quality is really impressive. So there you go. That's an example of a prompt that didn't work, a prompt that did work in the five principles that by the way scale. If you are watching this in a month or two months and it's not Claude anymore, right? Claude went downstream. It went from max plans to plus plans. But now Claude is not the best and co-pilot is incredible for PowerPoint or Chad GPT is amazing for PowerPoint. Great. The principles will still be there. The principles won't go anywhere. The way you work with a tool to generate a analyzed result in a narrative arc in a visual format that's not going anywhere. This I would argue is the hardest task for work primitives that we have in regular corporate knowledge work. I think it's harder than code. I think it's harder than Excel. And I think it's harder than docs in all three of those issues like text, docs, code, spreadsheets, the AI can already do it much better. It's much more fluent. You can give it longer prompts. It works especially with Excel now. And also with code, but not with PowerPoint. PowerPoint, you still have to hold hands. And the reason why is it's the combination of the analysis, dealing with conflicting data logic, and then getting it into something that is clean and visual. Once we get this right, we are going to change how stories are told in business settings. We are going to get cleaner powerpoints. We are going to get better iteration so that humans can focus more on the storytelling. Very excited about it. But it all rests on being able to actually get the thing to write good powerpoints. And that is clearly a promptsensitive art right now. It is not something that you can do and just say h just off you go, right? Like write the PowerPoint. If you want a short two or three slide deck and you have very simple data, yeah, that will work. If you have any kind of sort of production data and you have a significant deck to do, it will not work. And that is why I built this whole prompting approach. I hope this has been helpful for you. I hope you enjoyed seeing a Nate prompt that did not make the cut. And uh I'll see you next
