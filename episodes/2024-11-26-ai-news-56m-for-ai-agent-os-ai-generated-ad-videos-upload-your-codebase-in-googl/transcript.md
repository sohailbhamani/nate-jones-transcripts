# AI News: $56M for AI Agent OS, AI Generated Ad Videos, Upload your Codebase in Google Gemini

four pieces of AI news today two of them are actually on the image and video front which I don't tend to talk about as much but it's seen huge steps forward between flux Pro which is the first thing I want to call out and Luma ai's dream machine which is around video you have essentially the jump to undetectable image quality on video and on photos for AI driven content so that means if I tell the AI to make a photo on flux Pro in 4k it's reasonable that 98 99% of people are not going to notice the difference versus an actual photograph taken of a real scene now if I put flying hippopotamus is in there people are probably going to know its AI but if I make it a intentionally realistic looking scene no one can tell and that matters because anytime you get to a spot where it becomes undistinguishable versus reality you become a conduit for misinformation and so tools like this super useful super helpful but they're going to have a dark side as well the other major image one is the dream machine released by Luma AI I am just so impressed at the way video has evolved I remember a year ago when I was looking at AI video and I was just kind of rolling my eyes because it wasn't close but with dream machine we're now at a point where short form video is something that is almost indistinguishable from actual video shot with professional cameras by videographers and we're making huge strides on character persistence so the idea that a character's face image likeness is something that could be persistent from frame to frame and you have a stable sense of character that was also something that we didn't get a year ago and we're now making real strides on so this is just a periodic update to basically call out that we are in a place where AID driven uh video and image generation is on par with what you get with the physical camera in the real world except in the case of longform video and what's interesting is this is very similar to where we're at right now with large language models and text where short form content and factual content with an large language model is on par with what you get with all but the best writers but long form narrative like stories or novels isn't anywhere close and I think that's super interesting okay okay moving on to the next piece of news beyond the image world uh a company called slev agents got $56 million in funding they're founded by ex googlers ex stripe folks and their goal is to build the operating system for agents and I say that like I don't report all of the different funding rounds but I think this one's significant because the leadership involved and because of their focus on building essentially the infrastructure layer for agents I think it's a really smart play and I expect that they will do well and I think the size of the raise reflects the confidence of the investor community that this is a good spot to park cash in hopes of return so slev agents I would expect more from them soon finally uh the rumor is that Google's Gemini uh llm is going to offer a service called code base upload in December where you going to be able to upload a thousand files and up to 100 100 uh megabytes I believe of pure code I don't know we'll have to see kind of how that goes rumors are rumors but my sense is this is a step in the direction of a longer context window and the idea is that we want more and more to have the llm operative across the entire codebase now I know some code bases get far far far larger than this and uploading will not be the way to handle that but I do think getting to a point where an llm can reliably work across a thousand different files is a big step toward the idea of near infinite context Windows which is something that execs uh certainly at Microsoft and some other places have been hinting at in 2025 so we will see but it's it's an early sign from Google that we're starting to see those context Windows expand all right well that's your news for today got the images you got the video try and not do disinformation guys um and yeah we'll have to see how how the future unfolds and what tomorrow holds
