# 3 Jobs AI is Better At That Humans Will Keep Doing Anyway LOL

I want to talk about three jobs that the IMF would classify probably as nostalgic jobs in the age of AI and we have evidence that they're already nostalgic jobs what does nostalgic mean it means a job that humans want humans to do even if AI is provably better at that job I'm going to give you these three examples based on recent studies the first one is doctors yes doctors so I'm going to give you two examples of how AI is better than doctors number one is the diagnosis case you want doctors to be able to tell you what's wrong with you you trust them to they go to medical school well in this test gp4 was given a case history and so were doctors they were both asked for a diagnosis gp4 got it correct 90% of the time doctors got it correct 74% of the time and you think to yourself doctors with AI that is the answer it is not the answer my friend doctors got it correct with AI 76% of the time 2% more than if they were just using their own judgment which suggests very strongly to me that doctors are proud and do not want to admit that the AI has a point and that is going to have to change another medical study same idea in this case we're just answering medical questions like the cross effects of drugs can I take this with that Etc so in this case a doctor was asked to write an answer and Chad gp4 was asked to write an answer Chad GPT 4's answers were longer like much longer like 200 words versus roughly 50 words by the doctor and medical professionals were asked to assess the quality of the answer and separately the empathy demonstrated by the answer Chad GPT crushed it at empathy it was 45% of chat gpt's answers are rated as empathetic versus 4% for doctors so the bedside manner argument for human doctors apparently gone you might think well correctness maybe chat GPT doesn't know all about this no Chad GPT got 80% of the questions correct more than the doctors and so here we are the chat GPT is more empathetic it can answer questions more correctly it diagnoses better even with AI doctors still struggle the clear answer is doctors go away and AI rule the day no it's not and the reason why is because as humans we want someone who is suffered and who has been sick to diagnose us I do not want even reading this study and bringing it to you I do not want a doctor who is not human I do think doctors are going to need to learn to work with AI but that's a different day and another story a second job that is a nostalgic job poetry so a study was done where they took less pop popular poems by very very well-known artists like some Cher's less well-known poems Emily Dickinson's less well-known poems TS Elliots less well-known poems and they paired those with poems produced by I kid you not Chad GPT 3.5 so this is not the new writing release by 40 this is just 3.5 so they do all of that work they pair the poems they tell 3.5 to write five poems in the the same style as these poems by choser and Dickinson that are real but like in the back catalog on the B side humans can't tell the difference and humans like the AI poems better and the studies authors hypothesize this is because I kid you not the poems are worse so AI poems are direct they cut to the point they have less subtext there's less meaning there and humans like that it's easier to get to it's like a McDonald's Happy Meal you can just go and get it I like my poems complicated like wrestling with them and this totally made sense to me because I've done this test I have asked my AI to write and this was 40 with the writing update I asked it to write in the style of a poet that I like could not do it was not very convincing to my mind but was it easy to understand yes was it a poem yes did it have a style reminiscent of that poet absolutely and so I think this is going to be another example of nostalgic jobs we are not going to stop studying choser we are not going to stop publishing and printing books by human poets I would suggest we are more likely to go to poetry readings because we know a human wrote it and so this is going to be a nostalgic job third example art you might think to yourself well AI art right the fingers are all wrong so this was a study done on 11,000 participants and they did weight the scales they did throw out some of the really obvious AI art where like you have two legs off a foot and stuff that's just goes wrong and everyone knows what it is is and they were left with pretty good-looking AI art that mimic different styles so digital style 2010s Impressionists Dutch uh like verir Etc well great the question was could the humans tell the difference and what did the humans like and the answer is that the humans could a little bit tell the difference with visual art 60% right on guessing which was Ai and which was human generated when they were in similar Styles but that's just slightly better than chance and the top two most liked pieces of Art in the entire test they were AI generated and I looked at them they're quite nice again I do not think this means that artists are out of a job in fact I think things like live painting and uh exhibitions of human art are going to be even more appreciated in person in the future because you know that a human put their soul into it I think we're going to see a commoditization of Art into multiple classes which is something we've seen since I don't know when like the 1950s maybe I'm not an art historian but fundamentally there's been this bifurcation where there's High art that we appreciate the humans made and there's like industrial art that gets put onto all the things we live and breathe with every day I think industrial art is going to be commoditized into AI art your wallpaper AI designed I'm sure your bedspread will be AI designed I'm sure that kind of thing is going to go to AI really rapidly and Human Art is going to stay Human Art invaluable so there you go three jobs poet artist doctor all of them AI arguably does better already by the measure of humans involved none of them I think are really in danger of not existing anymore because they are nostalgic jobs and I want us to think more about that because what we humans value we can continue to invest in there you go tell me what you think I'll link all the papers in the description
