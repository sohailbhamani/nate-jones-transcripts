# Meta is Building Robots and AI Brain Implants, Claude 4 Soon

two updates from meta today plus one from anthropic we'll do the anthropic one first it's real quick strong strong rumors the information dropped it yesterday that Claude 4 is coming within the next couple of weeks and it's interesting specifically because Claude 4 is supposed to be both a reasoning model and a non- reasoning model and what I mean by that is it's sort of like what Sam mman described chat gp5 as being when he tweeted about it yesterday where he said it would just magically know it would magically pick the right things to do with the query you gave it that's what Claude is apparently going to do it's going to magically decide whether to reason or not to reason uh depending on the use case obviously this is huge news because Claud has been so important with uh development and so if Claude can suddenly decide when to reason really intelligently about coding problems that's a super interesting breakthrough to keep an eye on also anthropic is rumored to be releasing a continuous slide in their API so that developers have fine grain control of a reasoning effort when they request Claude 4 we will see how much if any of this is true when it releases but I think that the fact that anthropic is out with that helps us understand why Sam decided to go public with his road map when he did yes probably responding to deep seek but knowing the Rivalry between anthropic and open AI it's also a bit of a um pregame for the Claude FL release so that everyone knows that chat GPT is also working on something that both chooses when to reason and chooses not to reason anthropic news two things from meta first they're building robots uh I I was a little surprised uh Zuck is definitely in founder mode uh I don't know where he's going to go with his VR metaverse stuff Zuck indicated at the last earnings call that he's he gave a hint that he's thinking about sort of discontinuing investment there and if if he winds that back a little bit is possible he uses the cash from that to help fund the robot play but apparently they're it's going to be a big play like they're going to manufacture their own humanoid robot Hardware they're going to have it do household chores they want to understand AI sensors and software so that you can actually like provide software to other companies that'll also manufacture Hardware to me that reads like in Everything But the Kitchen snc strategy uh pardon my humor because that robot would actually be in my kitchen sink doing the dishes uh and the idea that the company that makes Facebook is doing my dishes is just very weird um but that's apparently a play that Zuck is working on uh and I think it underlines how big this opportunity feels to CEOs in the AI space if if the social media company is getting into making the robots the robot thing is a big trend for the next five years so we'll see how far this goes uh um and it's I I want to especially watch the timing of this leak these things often leak for a reason because they want to get ahead of something else and you'll notice that there's an Apple event scheduled for next week that no one really knows what it is and so I do wonder if meta is trying to get a a jump on Apple by leaking this now second thing from meta is they figured out how to use AI to decode language and essentially give people a non-invasive scan so that they could have their thoughts recorded directly to text now you've seen various versions of this in Sci-Fi movies we've had scientific studies on it in the past the difference here is they're using an artificial intelligence model and they're getting to real time latency with 80% accuracy and that is a big step forward uh I'll put the paper on that in the YouTube description as well so that's some of the news we've got uh kind of a mixed bag uh I don't know how I feel about uh Mark Zuckerberg's Rob doing my dishes but that's the future we might be in
