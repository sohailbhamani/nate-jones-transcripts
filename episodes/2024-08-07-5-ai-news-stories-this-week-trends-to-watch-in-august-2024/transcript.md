# 5 AI News Stories This Week: Trends to Watch in August 2024

AI is moving so fast I have trouble keeping up with it sometimes here are five pieces of news that I paid attention to over the first week of August number one the University of waterl researchers did a survey to find out what ordinary people think I'm not counting myself as ordinary because I work in Tech and I look at this all day so people who don't stare at AI all day what are they thinking about whether AI is conscious or not whether it passes what we call the Turing test which is the traditional test for AI and the sort of human uh interactions and whether AI counts as human by the way it does pass the touring test now and we found out that's not very useful so net net the researchers just straight out ask like what do you think of AI is ai ai conscious and the overwhelming answer is that most people think that AI has some degree of Consciousness like two-thirds or so now I'm not in that two-thirds bucket uh I've looked at the at the way the systems are put together I understand enough about token generation to sort of understand what's happening but I can also really understand why if you don't understand it it makes sense that it's conscious because if we look around us at the animal kingdom unless you speak whale we're the only people who are speaking language that we understand and we have long Associated the ability to speak speak language with the ability to be smart and now here we have something that has infinite memory or it seems infinite right it's it's understood so much about what we've written as a species you can ask it about just about any topic Humanity has explored it will tell you something and at the same time it's just predicting the next token of the next word people have a really hard time wrapping their heads around that one and I think the simplifier that most people take kind of understandably is that if it walks like a dock and it talks like a duck it's probably a duck it talks like a human so it probably has some of the internal experiences of a human is the way people sort of assume things and what's interesting is that bleeds into the way people perceive AI in ways that we in product we in Tech we in marketing need to think about because another survey dropped this one from Washington State University and it talks about how AI in every case that they checked does not improve perceptions of a product marketing copy I'm going to say it again AI or the use of the word artificial intelligence does not improve the perception of the product and marketing copy and furthermore the more expensive and the more High consideration the purchase the more likely it is to yield a negative effect in other words people trust it less the pricier it is that makes sense to me especially if you combine it with that first sort of note around artificial intelligence and how people think of it as actually intelligent as actually sort of human in some ways if you have some fear if you have some uncertainty if you have some doubt around what AI really is whether AI is going to sort of take over maybe you watch Terminator as a kid you are not going to love the idea of AI in your toaster or AI in your fridge or AI wherever they're advertising it as a benefit like AI by itself is not going to be perceived as a benefit so when we're building products we actually have to talk about what the AI unlocks I keep saying this and it's true like if you can't articulate the use case for what the AI is bringing to the customer AI by itself isn't going to work it's like back in the 1990s I remember when people would want to talk about how their company was green and they would literally take out newspaper ads or magazine ads and they would greenwash the page and they would put a nice little like jungle leaf with a little like Drop of water on it that is kind of where we're at when it comes to putting Ai and slapping it on things just to say it has Ai and this study is basically saying that doesn't actually help you you may think it does because if you live inside this tiny bubble intact you think about AI all the time you talk about AI all the time but it doesn't actually help you with like people outside of this little all right um number three strategic partnership between optimiz Le and Cavo and the reason I call this out is because I've been looking for moments where you see people putting money on the line associated with specific results in the commercial space and Ai and so in this case optimizely has decided it is important enough to get into the AI game the large language model game they need to partner with a firm that essentially specializes in Aid driven content generation for Enterprise so what Cavo does is they work in the Cs space they work in the website personalization space and what they claim is that they can drive significant improvements in conversion rates on your website in customer satisfaction scores in resolving customer success issues just by heavily personalizing the content to you and that that wouldn't be possible unless you're doing it at scale with a large language model driven solution optimiz is looking at that they want to take that I'm sure and put that into testing they want to take that and put that into their CMS their content management system and what what's this is not an acquisition as far as I can tell this is a partnership agreement between the two but it's still like there's commercial terms and I call that out because it means that there's enough interest in the market for this kind of solution there's enough track record of delivering commercial value based on large language models from Cavo that the partnership is worth it and that's a good sign like if you're looking at like what are you building and where are you showing value like I've been calling out that we need to see cases like this where Enterprises are showing value in the marketplace that are driven by AI that they are saying they couldn't get any other way and Cavo is saying this and Optimizer is basically saying Cavo is right we're going to Buddy up number four is somewhat similar so Shopify on earnings estimates uh I think it was yesterday August 6th and the reason that's compelling is because Shopify attributed the Beats to their use of AI enabled tooling to get more merchants in the door and it unlocked sort of a thought pattern for me around sort of places where people can start to use Ai and build against it at the end of the day if you are in shopify's shoes you already have a million plus merchants on the platform you certainly can roll out AI tooling to the merchants you have that's fine that's not necessarily going to drive your Topline Revenue the way getting the next Merchant in the door well because you make money off of the platform fees but you also make money off of expanding the footprint and your sort of surface area for transactions overall and what's interesting is they're they're essentially saying that AI enabled tooling made it easier for Merchants to come in and start using Shopify they did not clarify if that meant it was easier to switch and you were an established Merchant if it's easier to start a new shop as a merchant I don't know but intuitively the idea that a lot of the work that you do setting up a shop is susceptible to a token generation model where it's like very text based you need to produce a lot of the text the text has specific rules associated with it that you just need to do over and over again you need to complete it to a high quality bar to set up your shop all of that makes sense that's a good use case for where you would stick a large language model to make it substantially easier which would in turn make it more likely that people would be able to complete that series of activities get to a launch of their shop and start be able being able to take transactions which in turn would allow Shopify to monetize so that's a long way of saying I think this is another use case sort of like the caveo use case where you can actually see AI being used to commercial advantage in the marketplace and the market AE it up I think Shopify got a massive valuation about 10 15% or something I'm sure like it's different now because that's how stocks move but the initial reaction was very large because the market is so hungry for news about AI that involves Revenue last thing I want to call out uh this one you may not have heard of these guys zest AI um I'm calling them out because one of the things that has been a problem across a range of Industries uh so publish comes to mind uh anywhere where you have applications comes to mind college applications loan applications uh anywhere you have a need to write a lot of text Grant applications these things are all getting inundated with extra volume now that llms are here because llms have made producing high quality text cheap it's so cheap now and so if you work in the publishing world as an agent you just get like overwhelmed drowned in manuscripts of questionable quality in many cases if you work in job applications I've talked about this you get overwhelmed in resumés many of which are questionable quality because of AI what's interesting about this story is that zest has decided that they are going to invest in Aid driven fraud detection software that is designed to catch fraudulent applications and help Underwriters not accept and I think that's interesting because it's sort of the I I think it's the Leading Edge of this idea that you know AI enables a lot of Supply in the marketplace from a tech perspective but AI is also going to enable more filtering and we haven't really had that I think the market is super hungry for it and I'm really curious to see where this goes it just launched we don't really have a lot of traction yet on it um they're claiming it really helps with reducing bad debt so if you work in fintech you understand bad debt is what you want to avoid it's where you take people take out a loan and don't pay you back and they're saying something like a 40% reduction in bed debt in their in their pilot testing and we will see but my sense is that we are going to have a whole lot more tools like this and that's why I wanted to flag it we're going to have more tools that help you deal with the supply of very cheap wording that llms have enabled because that is becoming a problem it is exceeding human abilities to filter it which is why some people and this is anecdotal but some people are giving up on the coldly pipeline entirely and I don't just mean job Seekers I mean in some cases companies are saying we are just going to go with referrals and the application pipeline is something we won't pay a lot of attention to because at the end of the day the quality through there is so low thanks to llms it's really tough to get any kind of hit rate on the interviews that you do just just off all day applications now not every company's like that don't walk away and say oh Nate said that you know cold applications are gone it's just that the supply has distorted the market and I think that the filtering AI is coming in and it's going to shut so those are your five pieces of news we had the University of water loose study the Washington State University study on AI help not helping in marketing uh we had optimized Le CBO in Partnership we had Shopify beating on earnings with AI tooling and we had zest AI talking about tooling around filtering uh out essentially fraudulent applications powered by AI was sort of the implication so that's what we've got for just the first week of August uh I hope you had fun with this uh I'm trying to call out the things that are actually driving Trends here and not just sort of random pieces of news I'll link a couple of things underneath so you can find them and uh have a great week
