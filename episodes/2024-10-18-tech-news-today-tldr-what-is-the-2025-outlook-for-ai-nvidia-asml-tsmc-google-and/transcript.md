# Tech news today TLDR: What is the 2025 outlook for AI? NVIDIA, ASML, TSMC, Google, and Amazon

we're going to go through five news items from the week that you might have missed and the first one you definitely missed because it didn't happen and that's interesting that is news that it did not happen the 4.50 model for open AI did not drop and there was a lot of rumor that it would drop this week and the reason why it didn't is probably because anthropic did not drop their model and so what we have right now is a situation where anthropic and Google and open AI all probably have better models lying on the Shelf metaphorically speaking but none of them want to release them for fear of losing the pr Buzz that comes from a model release that's immediately followed by another company releasing their model and then claiming it's great so everyone's sitting there like what do we do right everyone's waiting for the other person to drop the model right now I don't know how that's going to get resolved that's up to open Ai and Google and anthropic we will see I would expect that eventually the market pressure is going to be high enough that a model will drop the current rumor as of this week is that open AI has gone back to looking at just waiting until the fifth generation or 550 model comes out and they're not going to release a halfway model I don't know like the the definition of halfway releases is weird in llms anyway because how do you measure the performance of something that's a halfway through a generation you haven't released yet I don't know so the point is they didn't release it they didn't release it because of interesting game theory reasons where everyone staring at everyone else waiting for someone else to go first H and we will just have to see how that resolves who will jump in the water first with the Next Generation model we shall see number two did happen Google and Microsoft and Amazon are now all in the nuclear power game so we heard about Microsoft earlier Amazon Inked a 500 something million deal for nuclear this week Google Inked a deal for a lot of power but they would not name a figure which probably means it was also a lot of money bottom line the big players in Cloud are seeing that their energy demands are about to get so high that they have to have nuclear to handle them and they need small reactors that are close to the data centers to provide continuous power which means that future data centers are not just going to be data centers they're going to have like a small modular nuclear reactor running the data center right there and you might wonder well why is that right like why do they need that much more power well it's because the new Chips need more power to run if you install nvidia's new blackw chip architecture which is what's shipping right now which is what's booked out for the rest of 2025 like the whole year they've sold out of Blackwell that's what is running all of the model inference for these new next gener generation training uh runs for these new models that you know anthropic and open Ai and Google are trying to build well that has 208 billion transistors per chip as opposed to the mo the chips that were used to train current chat GPT models they they came in at you know only 80 billion uh so this is a lot it's it's a much smarter chip right it also sucks more power and so blackw chips if you put them in a server rack for a data center are going to be coming in at 60 to 120 KW per rack and most data centers just don't have the power configuration to handle that they top out at like less than 50 kilowatts per rack and if that's the case it's going to be hard like you have to this explains the data center revamp you have to essentially revamp your data center to handle the newest generation chips to build the nice models and so that is why when you look at office construction figures in the US they're doing very well because it turns out that for reasons I don't fully understand data centers are C categorized as a kind of office in most US economic reports and so the reason why we have been building new offices is because we've been building new data centers and we've been building new data centers to handle the power consumption so this brings us to one of the more surprising pieces of news for the week um asml flopped and when I say that asml is the Dutch company that builds the fabrication machines that make the chips that run our world they build them for the runs that make these blackw chips for NVIDIA but they build them for everybody else too the stock flopped and they lost something like $75 billion in market capitalization this week and scared everybody because they came in about5 billion lower on their sales guidance for 2025 than everyone had expected and their bookings which are like the future orders for chips right they came in at half what people expected now they have a big backlog like they're working through like a 30 some billion dollar backlog for their bookings but the fact that bookings came in at like two and a half billion instead of five scared the markets briefly everybody who had exposure to AI in their company portfolio took a bath on the stock market like everybody got scared it's since evened out and I'll explain why so asml essentially said this is not about AI this is about the fact that certain fabrication forges so certain places where you make chips are delayed now there's one that's really delayed that is relevant to the forecast and it's the Intel Forge in Germany that got pushed back and it got pushed back because Intel has been having real trouble making chips they are falling behind in the chip race and it is impacting their ability to make Capital Investments that in turn hits asml the other reason is that asml has been selling fabrication units to China and there is speculation that export controls are going to go on that will limit their ability to do that going forward and so that is part of why they slashed their guidance they said they expect China Revenue to drop down to about 20% of their total revenue versus 50% uh in the past year or so okay if if if that all felt like a snooze to you the tldr is that the the company that makes the machines that make the chips that run our world came in at lower than expected Revenue guidance which matters because everyone has been expecting these chip guys to do really really well if all needing all of these chips to run Ai and basically what asml said is it's not about Ai and then we heard just today from tsmc yes I know these guys all have acronyms tsmc is the Taiwanese company that is the most advanced chip manufacture in the world and so the most advanced chip architectures like Blackwell which we just talked about come from Taiwan and tsmc has said that they have got so many orders is they can barely keep up with demand they've said that they have a healthy 5-year Outlook 54% rise in quarterly profit they beat expectations these guys who are actually building the AI chips are doing fine in fact they're the most valuable company listed in Asia right now and so when you look at it that way the story to me looks very much like AI is doing fine until delayed fabrication unit asml needs to adjust expectations there you go that's the news for the week oh one more notebook LM dropped their actual product and you can pass a note to the podcasters which I will be doing check out notebook LM if you haven't all right cheers
