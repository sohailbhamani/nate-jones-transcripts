# AI News Today: AI Loses Job to Humans, Agentic AI Discovers SQLite Vulnerability, o1 Model Leak

three pieces of AI news today number one 01 was released on Saturday morning very briefly some people say it was a Gorilla Marketing stunt other people say it was unintentional I am torn I think on the one hand this absolutely fits the playbook for open ai's habit of drumming up attention before a major release so in that sense it looks like a marketing stunt on the other hand I don't think they intent intentionally wanted to release a model that does um full and uncensored drug recipes which is this one immediately did uh and it was only out for two hours so it's gone now uh but you could have changed the uh open AI URL early on Saturday morning and you can immediately see 01 if you can type in 01 in the browser and that's how you got to it so the for the few people that got to it during that 2-hour window who were changing the URL pointer they were able to see that 01 has a large uh context window so 200,000 tokens uh I know it's not the biggest but largish and they were able to see that 01 is able to search the web which again current o1 can't and also 01 is able to handle images and do very sophisticated image analysis my favorite example of that actually was a one working out a good chess strategy off of a single image provided of a chess board so we will see what happens the rumors are that 01 is coming out tomorrow Tuesday we will see if that's the case hopefully they fix the drug recipe thing piece of news number two a Polish radio station named off is going to put their human presenters back on the air they had fired them previously in what they said was quote unquote an experiment and had decided to use AI radio presenters apparently using AI radio presenters is not something that the public wanted to do particularly when those AI radio presenters decided to interview dead Nobel laurates like uh thewa zimura which I'm probably not pronouncing right I worked on it but I don't think I got it right uh who is a Polish Nobel laurate who died a few years ago and the public was outraged because you don't do that like that's inappropriate and the radio station decided to go off the air haha off off and come back with human presenters so AI isn't going to take all of our jobs yet piece of news number three uh an AI agentic tool called Big Sleep discovered a security vulnerability in SQ light servers but well the SQ server architect cure in the development uh Fork that was happening not in production so this was in a development branch and it was able to discover a memory overlo overflow security vulnerabil vulnerability and it was fixed and then it was disclosed after it was fixed so there not currently a vulnerability it's certainly not production just to be clear but from a AI use case perspective it's helpful because it's nice to know that you can have some help with assessing security vulnerabilities for large projects so there you go if you hadn't heard of big sleep I encourage you to check them out I will uh link to their project page okay there you go that's the News That's fit to print we have an 01 Leak with drug recipes we have a Polish radio station named off trying to fire presenters and failing and we have a AI tool called Big Sleep that assesses security vulnerabilities s
