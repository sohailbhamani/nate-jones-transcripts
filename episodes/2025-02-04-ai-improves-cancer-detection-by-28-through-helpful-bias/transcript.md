# AI Improves Cancer Detection by 28% Through Helpful Bias

what if AI was actually helpfully biased that's a core question that the authors of a major new AI study asked in the lens set yesterday the lens set is a prestigious medical journal and they were reporting on the results of using AI to improve breast cancer detection rates in women in Sweden at scale by the way this is over a 100,000 uh women who participated and what they discovered was this is not a situation where AI is going to independently diagnose uh women and then have doctors come in and try and second guess the AI that wasn't going to be productive instead they realized that they could get more value by having AI bias the human reader of the mamography toward correct spots to look at on the mamography to confirm breast cancer presence in other words they had the AI literally Circle parts of the mamography where it was like this looks like a problem and then aign a risk and they found that by biasing the human reader because that's what you're doing you're basically saying look here look here look here look at the risk score that that was really helpful it was helpful in increasing correct or true detection rates and it had no statistically significant increase on false positives so they weren't biasing the reader and then everything became breast cancer it was that they were correctly pointing the reader attention toward areas in the image that needed review and this was so effective that they were successfully able to keep a second reader out of the loop and so typically with mamography exams I didn't know this either like when you're looking at the image and you're reviewing it you have a two reader scenario where you have uh you know reader one looks at it and says this is my diagnosis reader two looks at it says this is my diagnosis and you sort of use two human pairs of eyes to check essentially the AI replaced one of the human pairs of eyes is with guided instruction to the second human and said hey I looked at this first this is what I'm seeing this is the risk score what do you think and that proved to be super effective I find that fascinating because we've seen other we've seen other medical settings where the AI ends up not being used by the doctor and the AI is better than the doctor at medical reasoning and does so independently and you can kind of show it in the in the test results that oh yeah I got the diagnosis right but this is live patience it's not just a test result thing and it figures out a way to structure AI involvement so that humans are able to work with AI in clinical settings and I think that that's a really huge breakthrough because effectively this quote unquote biasing that they're doing is enabling the human to do their job more effectively with a higher degree degree of accuracy and is enabling the AI to play its best role of providing correctness at a spot in the value chain where it can actually be used and that's been my real worry is that at the end of the day like you're going to have tremendously smart artificial intelligence systems that aren't positioned well within our current work context and so they don't actually bring value and this is a situation where that's not true the AI was positioned at a point where a human Medical Professional could read the image and the AI suggestions interpret that and make a decision and it worked really well and it saved people's lives and that was a good thing um I want to see more like that I want to see more situations where we have ai that is helpfully biased AI that helps us to think more correctly and that gives people a sense that they have superpowers that they have the ability to see better more accurately consistently over time for areas where they're already professionals or areas where they're already good I'm hoping that this is something that we see extended across more clinical settings I think with the Mayo Clinic coming out with the uh x-ray Imaging with AI we're going to actually see a lot on medical imaging I don't know if you know this this came out in 2017 it's not news but uh it's interesting medical imaging has been an area where AI systems have made progress for a long time I think it was back in 2017 uh and we still haven't solved this uh an AI system figured out how to tell the difference between women and men by staring at their eyeballs like an image of the iris but there is no known medical structure that accounts for the difference between men and women in eyeballs like doctors can't do this doctors look at the eyeball and they're like I don't know it looks like an eyeball uh but the but the AI looks at the eyeball and is able to figure out what gender the person is and we don't know what structures they're looking at and that actually is the second thing I liked about this study I I know we went from eyeballs back to the study the second thing I liked is they made this explainable at the end of the day this was hey look over here it wasn't I detect breast cancer in this image good luck please enjoy finding it was here it is right here you know we're Circle at this is the suspicious area um that makes it more explainable and I think that's really important for people to trust these systems so there you go the land set 100,000 people AI helped with uh screening for breast cancer cheers
