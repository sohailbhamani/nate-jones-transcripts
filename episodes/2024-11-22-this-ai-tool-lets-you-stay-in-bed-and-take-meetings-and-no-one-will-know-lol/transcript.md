# This AI Tool Lets You Stay in Bed and Take Meetings and No One Will Know lol

so pickle just released and it's a phenomenal example of how to Think Through complex problems in the age of AI pickle is a tool that you can use to join a zoom conversation as if you are there at the desk live but it's not live it's an AI Avatar and you're like well there's lots of people working on that that may be true but the way pickle has done it has enabled them to get to Market faster and that's what I love about this so if you think about the problem of people being in meetings you think well we have to solve for the way people look the way people talk the limp syncing the llm needs to actually generate the content the llm needs to understand what's being said this gets very complicated then you get into voice you get into accent it's a really hard problem and it has a lot of dimensions and that's why we don't have a full solution I mean you could also just not have the meeting I'm a big fan of that okay the reason why pickle is in Market is because pickle has only taken a part of that whole problem set and delivered it and that's what enabled them to get to Market faster so all pickle does is it takes live audio that you produce you still have to be in the meeting listen to it and talk back and it produces an AI Avatar riew that's photorealistic in a professional location and it lip syncs you live that's it it took everything else away like it doesn't have to worry about accent because you produce the voice it doesn't have to worry about the llm really understanding what's being said because again you're the one in the meeting and that choice has enabled them to solve one of the most persistent issues in a busy remote work or partial remote work context which is that people are going about their lives they're working but they may be in different contexts so for example if you're driving in the car normally you would go audio on if you choose to participate but in this situation you are able to just plug your own audio in listen and the camera that you use is a zoom camera tied to the pickle app and it just shows an AI Avatar view that they've built lip syncing to your audio so you could be driving and participating in the zoom meeting you could be holding the baby and participating in the zoom meeting and this is a really tangible paino I can't count the number of times when it's been a little bit odd because people are out doing things this and that and they're not actually at the desk in a way that enables them to participate but their audio is there they're they're present mentally and so I look is this perfect is everybody going to use this enough people are using it that they're uh clone production is delayed so I think they're getting some interest I suspect more than you think will sign up for this and the reason why is that if you think about the pain point the the biggest pain Point actually is being able to consistently convey an office-like impression and that's what pickle is going after it's a much different paino if you want to say your time spent in meetings is a problem everyone would agree with that but very few people are going to trust an AI to just bite off and solve that without proof like literally me not being in the meeting I have to trust the AI to summarize correctly I have to trust the AI to be me that's an extremely high bar but just trusting the AI to look like it it can sit in an office chair and lip sync while I walk around the house doing dishes and talk much lower bar much much more easy so I and the funny thing is I don't think I don't think people are going to notice when this is used like I have seen the demo it takes too long to create the Clone so like it dropped today I haven't got a clone yet but I have seen the demo and I don't think people are going to notice and the funny thing is that means that people are not going to have like a virality factor it will have a whisper factor for spreading but it won't have a virality factor because there won't be a little logo because by definition you don't want people to know you use this which is going to make their product adoption really interesting so so I think they've solved one of the most relevant pain points in the entire sort of meeting problem space and I think they've solved it well enough that your colleagues are going to start using it and I think the only way you're going to know is that the app has people just squarely facing the camera and making eye contact and I don't know about you but I like look off into the distance I look off over here like I'm much more Dynamic when I'm in a meeting and I think that piece is going to stand out over time but but it's a good idea I think a lot of people are going to use it and I am really really curious to see other kinds of products in these problem spaces that choose something that is painful to Consumers but relatively easy for AI and that go after that if you're interested in getting your lifelike AI clone uh you can go to get pickle. aai and no this is not an endorsement of any kind this is just me thinking this is a really really interesting problem space so there you go check out getp pickle. and let me know what you think
