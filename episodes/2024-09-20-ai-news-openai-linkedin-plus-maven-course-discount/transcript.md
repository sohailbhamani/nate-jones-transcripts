# AI News: OpenAI, LinkedIn, plus Maven course discount

three big pieces of news and a note on how to get a discount on my AI Maven course news number one open AI is able to dictate any terms they want to get people to invest in them and maybe you and I aren't surprised but even I was a little bit surprised by how high those terms are for Venture capitalists they are saying if you are not willing to write $250 million checks you shouldn't be talking to them their next fundraising round will have at a minimum a quarter of a billion dollar checks in the round which shows how big that round is going to be they haven't announced the final size of it they're just starting the Rays but I would confidently expect it to be maybe close to hundred billion dollar it's going to be a big raise number two LinkedIn has decided to model non-consensual generative AI scraping they're not asking for your consent they are sticking a new setting inside their menu that says generative AI data collection preference or something like that I found it last night and they're defaulting it to on without telling you and so they're taking the largest private professional data pool in the world where like you and I are our professional selves and we're writing our content and they're saying all of that is ours to collect and train our model on but we don't have to tell you that we don't have to ask for your consent we can just do it now my understanding is because of gdpr folks in the EU don't have to worry about this but in the the US I would go into your settings and I would have a look and make sure you are choosing intentionally whether to share that data or not it's not acceptable for generative AI companies not to explicitly ask for consent when they make a change that big and I think it's important that we model a degree of expectation of accountability that that's not acceptable it's not okay you need to ask if you're going to collect people's data for the purpose of training an llm it's a norm that we need to establish finally I want to call out one of the interesting reasons why 01 mini is performing as well as 01 preview it turns out when you let 01 mini think for a little bit it does just as well almost as 01 preview in other words extra time when you send in an utterance for it to respond to is just as good as extra size on the model because 01 Min is a smaller model and for most of us for most of llm History our understanding has been certainly my understanding has been that if it's smaller it's generally not as good now you can argue it's a smaller model but it's specifically tuned and is better at this use case absolutely bu that but this is a general model and it's still using the thinking time to perform almost as well as 0 and preview and you can see that in the chatbot Arena uh scores you have two big scores that are ahead of everybody else right now they're like up here in the uh past 1300 1350s and then down here in the 1200s is every other model on the planet including Chad GPT 40 and 01 mini is performing that well because it's taking a little bit more time to think and that's called log linear Computing which is a mouthful to say but basically amounts to the idea that you can actually get those gains in intelligence from a larger model by giving the model time to respond I'll be talking more about this in my lightning lesson which is what I wanted to call out it's one of the key differences with the 01 models it's something we need to think about as far as the kinds of problems we give models and what we expect from them and uh you can sign up for it I'll throw a link down below if you want to Discount early also sign up for the wait list the discount code is dropping on Monday September 23rd and you want to be there it's a decent discount code for my mavin course so to recap lightning lesson will cover 01 it's free 30 minutes sign up and the wait list which is a nice discount right now on my Maven course is dropping on September 23rd and the reason why you might want to jump on that is because I've had a ton of interest I'm already up to almost 50 signups for the course uh I I want to make sure I have like appropriate instruction for everyone and so I actually don't know how big I can get the course before I have to cut it off so if you're interested in the course you should hop in so that I can be sure that I can provide you the kinds of instruction on AI that that you want that I love to give and that will help you accelerate your career because that's ultimate ultimately what this is all about is how can you accelerate your career
