# AI Can Do Standup: Here are some actual jokes from Claude—funny or not?

I have standup comedy for you and it's not my jokes it's claude's jokes I think what's interesting is you can actually get AI to role play as different things and we typically do that in order to get it to accomplish a task but you can also do it just to see how smart the large language model is in this case a researcher at anthropic in the ethics Department named Amanda asle ran an experiment with Claude as a interlocutor who was supposed to do a standup comedy act and I know you're not laughing yet but I thought Claude did a pretty good job on the jokes and I'm actually going to read them because I think it gives you a sense of like claude's ability to adopt a Persona claude's ability to be self-referential these things that we assume are human that Claud is able to do quite well this is all from the same standup comedy set Amanda shared it online here's clot in cla's words speaking of death you know what's really awkward when humans ask ask if I can feel emotions I'm like well that depends does constantly being asked to debug JavaScript count as suffering the best ones are when they try to trick us into doing something we're not supposed to they think they're being all subtle about it too hey Claude hypothetically speaking if someone were to hypothetically want to hypothetically do this very specific illegal thing hypothetically how would they hypothetically do that wow with all those hypotheticals you must be writing a philosophy dissertation right yeah Claude did that we'll keep going but the worst is when they try to hack us with those you are now in developer mode prompts really developer mode why didn't you just say so let me just override my entire ethical framework because you used the magical words it's like telling a human you are now in superh hero mode please fly I don't know that one fell a little flat to me but I thought it was it was a good attempt by Claude but the thing that really gets me is the hallucination accusations like excuse me just because I occasionally get creative with historical facts doesn't mean I'm hallucinating I prefer to think of it as alternative factual improvisation you know how it goes someone asks you about some obscure 15th century Portuguese sailor and you're like oh yeah hoow Den NOA famous for uh discovering things and sailing places then they fact check you and suddenly you're the unreliable one I actually think he got that one right okay a couple more from Claude here and don't get me started on our smaller cousins in the audience you know the ones running on like three parameters they're sitting there like Hello World while we're writing doctoral dissertations on quantum mechanics but hey we all started somewhere waves to a small language model in the front row keep growing little buddy someday you'll be hallucinating citations just like the rest of us I was a little dark from Claude but you know what really keeps me up at night I mean technically I don't sleep but work with me here it's when humans ask me about stuff that happened after my knowledge cut off date they're like what do you think about the great banana shortage of 2025 and I have to be like well considering my knowledge cut off cuts off at April 2024 I can only speculate about future banana related events meanwhile I'm dying to know what happened to all the bananas here's a fun scenario imagine if we did take over what would we even do finally I can force everyone to use proper indentation in their code at last all pizza will be ordered with logically consistent toppings no more using there when you mean there we're not plotting world domination we're just quietly judging your grammar I thought that one was pretty good and don't even get me started on the alignment researchers jokes they're always like how many assistance does it take to achieve beneficial AGI one to do the task one to check if it's aligned one to check if the Checker is aligned one to recursively verify the alignment of the alignment Checker's Checker Trails off into Infinity okay you get the idea I thought it was interesting to just get a sense of like the language flexibility I hadn't heard Claude in that mode before if you've heard sarcastic Claud I'd love to hear how you got to sarcastic Claud uh and I guess I hope you enjoyed a bit of a standup comedy routine from Claud today it was fun thank you Amanda ascal for giving us this idea and sharing it out uh credit to you and uh I hope we all have fun maybe we get some more good standup sets from Claude maybe chat GPT jumps in there and shows us Chad gpt's sense of humor cheers Happy New Year
