# AI News Today: Cancer, scaring Google, AI plagiarism, McKinsey

four pieces of AI news that you might have missed we're going to start with good news today there is a new AI cancer detection tool it works across 19 different types of cancers goes by the name chief for reasons I don't fully understand and it is apparently 96% accurate at detecting cancers across these 19 different types it also detects novel survivability characteristics which I'm not exactly sure what that is but it does sound positive so I think one of the interesting things is that we are starting to see this concept of a transformer-based architecture work across many many different applications in this case it's a chat GPT like interface that allows you to upload a slide of a cancer tumor and then the Transformer architecture will look through the pattern recognition based on the large training data set of cancers and come back with a response and that core Transformer based attention-based architecture is very very good at cancer detection just like it's good at language just like it's good at image generation it's a it's it's this is a remarkable time that we're living through to have one particular architecture in computer science work across so many fields okay that aside number two there is a family in Massachusetts that is suing their school because the school gave the kid a d on an assignment in social studies which is not by itself a sueable offense but apparently the child used Ai and there was no rule in the handbook that said the child couldn't use AI but on the basis of using AI the school is saying you get a d and what's interesting is the school is claiming that it's self-evidently cheating to use AI it's plagiarism and the parents are claiming it's not that the AI generated report is the child's property and the child's work we will see what happens but this is going to be one of those interesting cases to watch because in school settings plagiarism is obviously a problem in most places plagiarism is obviously a problem and at the end of the day you either believe that the AI is generative and is producing work in conversation with you based on a large training data set or you believe it's tent to amount to cheating and the courts are going to weigh in here and we will see what they say so that's number two number three the AI search engine perplexity has decided that it is worth three times what it was worth earlier this year and is Raising $500 million at A9 billion valuation up from three earlier these are the guys that just launched internal file search so previously they were just doing doing search engine like work like Google did but with uh much more in in-depth enriched High text summaries now they are doing internal file search they're doing the external file search and they are coming for financial charge they have some like Financial stuff that they launched recently where you can build Financial charts and I saw people get very excited and say that Bloomberg was in danger and if you've ever seen Bloomberg no they're not um one of the things that's interesting is with perplexity they are using very high intent keywords and so you have 10 or 11 words in a typical perplexity search and just two or three in a particular Google search and so the idea is they will be able to monetize more effectively than Google will because there's so much more information in that initial prompt we will see but that's the pitch that they're making to the investors all right number four last but not least Microsoft is launching AI agents we said it was coming by the end of the year here Microsoft is jumping into the right they are launching it with uh co-pilot they're allowing businesses to build it first and the application they gave I am not kidding you it's a McKenzie application and the application they gave is that the agent can read the McKenzie partner's email and figure out who to forward it to and that's their AI agent application and they say this will save McKenzie Partners 30% of their time I don't even have words Mackenzie partners are spending that much time on email McKenzie can't come up with this as a way sort of to to work with a a tech firm to to write this anyway because you've been able to do this you just have had to work on it yourself and roll your own code like yes Microsoft now has tools that allow you to do this with no code that's great but you've been able to parse emails run them through an llm generate responses and understand the semantic meaning for a while it's just putting the piece together that's taken a you know a tech team so apparently McKenzie hasn't had a tech team to do that hasn't thought of doing it and has decided to do it with Microsoft and Microsoft is very happy and has sort of given them a nice little graphical user interface with a little tree based architecture where you can like almost like zapier right like just Define what you want and it will magically work I think agents are going to feel a little bit they're going to feel a little bit blah if this is the way they're being introduced I think they have a ton of potential I think we're going to see agents which are much more exciting soon but this is not the way to introduce it agents that that just sort of do the partners email at McKenzie okay okay and I think they're going to be real productivity enhancers so like the boring agents are okay it's not bad but from a marketing perspective you'd want something with a little bit more Pizzazz so we will see we'll see what the Microsoft marketing team does they probably won't listen to me and those are your four pieces of news cancer which is good perplexity raising a triple the valuation so they must be getting increased usage we have the parents suing for AI and we have Microsoft launching AI agents but kind of picking a boring use case let me know what interesting use cases you've seen for AI agents
