# How to Get an AI Job in 2025 (Beyond OpenAI & Big Tech)

All right, settle in. We're going to have a talk about how to get a job in the age of AI. It's one of the biggest questions I get asked. I want to pack this video with absolutely everything I know. And I'm going to start with the startup targeting site. That's actually something most people don't talk about. Almost all of the job advice I see is what do you do with your resume? How do you work with Chad GPT? How do you prepare for an interview? Etc., etc. I want to focus this video on stuff that doesn't get talked about as much and how important those pieces are and then we'll get to the basic advice as well. So, first targeting a company. I'm going to suggest to you that your goal is not to get hired by OpenAI. Your goal is not to get hired by Anthropic. Your goal is not to get hired by Microsoft or any of the other major AI players. I'm not saying it's bad if you're employed there, and I'm not saying it's bad to get a job there. But if you're looking at it from a riskreward perspective, capital has been invested very very heavily in those businesses for AI and those businesses are already soaring in valuation. They already have most of the multiple for AI baked in and a lot of the money coming in is follow me money. Now why do you care as a job seeker? Because frankly the deal for a long time with startups and even with the entrepreneurial parts of big companies has been if you participate and you take the risk you get some of the upside you get some of the equity. But the problem is if the rounds are too juicy now you don't really get the upside. It is not really worth it to you to participate if your equity only doubles or triples in size. And I say that not because I I'm trying to say that the money isn't worth it, but because I'm trying to say the risk is too high. There is real risk at these startups. And I know it may seem like there's no risk because of all the money that's gone into it. But I have been at companies that have done very, very well and look like they were unsinkable and headed for the public markets and it didn't turn out that way. Anyone who has worked in startups for a long time has those kinds of war stories. We have stories where things didn't go as well as the nice little offer letter said. The multiples didn't turn out. So when you're targeting companies, one of the biggest things you can do is invest your time in a company. You are investing something that a VC cannot invest. They don't have time to invest. So they invest money and they hedge their risk because they're investing money in multiple startups. You're not. You're just you. You're investing your time, which you will never ever get back in a company. So, choose wisely. You got to pick well. And that's why I say I don't know that the hot model makers are really the best spot. Now, look, if you are the one in 100 million person who is being courted by Mark Zuckerberg for a generationally changing wealth compensation, sure, take the money. Absolutely, we all would. But if you're not, which most of us aren't, then think real carefully before trying to aspire to the big model makers. I'm going to make another somewhat controversial assessment here. I have been through multiple bubbles. Now, I also think that you should be thoughtful about targeting seed at this point in the cycle. Seed and preede is very, very crowded. There are a lot of seed and preed companies that are going to go to the wall in the next 12 to 18 months. They are companies that looked great on paper. They could raise a million on five and they are not going to make it to their aim and they are burning too much to be seedstared or like seed to profitability. It's just not going to happen for them. There is roughly there's 70 to 100,000 startups out there right now in the AI space. It's like a feeding frenzy and you have only one shot. And if you have only one shot, I would not take that shot on a seed stage company. I don't think that's your best bet. I think the risk is really high. And so you might say, "Well, Nate, you've just spent time saying the model makers aren't the best. You've said the big companies don't reward you. You've said the seed stage and preede stages is too risky. What's left?" I tell you, I think your sweet spot at this point in the cycle is like right around the A stage, like immediately before the A would be ideal. Right after the A maybe that's a place where they've proven some of the business model, at least historically, and there's still growth left on the bone. So, they're going to grow and you're going to get some multiple and there's enough value in the business that it was worth funding again. Now these days, as I mentioned, there is seedstrapping and so you may run into a situation where you're functionally at a but you're kind of bootstrapped. That's okay, too. In fact, that might be ideal because you get less of the sort of the drama that goes with VC versus founder, which can be exciting at times. So, if you're looking through your targeting lens, the lesson I want you to take away is not follow Nate's advice. The lesson I want you to take away is think carefully about your values and your targeting matrix and recognize that whether you agree with me or not, you also have only your time to invest. You don't get more time than I get. So you have to choose carefully. I don't think that gets said enough. Let's move from targeting companies to talking about the application perspective. This one gets talked about more because it's more I think immediately controllable. It lends itself to courses, etc. So, a lot of the advice I see, and I'm just going to rehearse it here, and then we'll get into sort of how I expanded, how I think about it. The general advice I see now in 2025, uh, you have to be on LinkedIn. You have to be active on LinkedIn. You have to fill in your LinkedIn profile really, really well with good keywords. You have to make sure that your resume is absolutely customized and tailored to that individual role. You want to make sure that your cover letter is really sharp. Some people don't read the cover letter, so you send the LinkedIn DM as well. You send cold emails. You send follow-ups 3 days, 7 days, 14 days later, maybe 21 days later. You might send a Loom video introducing yourself. Overall, you want to make sure you show passion for that particular startup and then you have to rinse and repeat it and do it a lot across every company that has a target job that you think is a very good fit. And the advice that I typically see, which I think is correct, is don't apply for roles where you're kind of an okay fit. You should be looking for 95% or better fit for the role. Look, here's what I have to say. At the end of the day, clearly and similar AI application strategies have poisoned the well so much on the entire resume system that I don't know how plausible it is to get a job as a strategy with cold applications. Does the engine still work? Technically, yes. People get jobs through cold applications every day. I know someone who got a job through a persistent cold application strategy this year in 2025 related to AI. It does happen. It is rarer than it was. It is very inefficient. It's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of patient applications. It is a long game. It is a months or even a year and a half game at this point. And so it's not that it can't happen, it's that it's harder and harder and harder because that engine of jobs is breaking down. So where do you go from here? I want to suggest that we go back to what has made startups an attractive place to work for people who build for a long time. It's actually not the risk. It's a little bit of the equity and the upside. Let's not kid ourselves. But it's the passion for the problem space that is what distinguishes people who stay in startups. That is what distinguishes people who stay in tech. They are passionate about solving a particular problem with technical leverage. And if you don't have that, it doesn't matter if you're an engineer like you have to be passionate about the problem space. If you don't have that passion, it is going to be difficult for you to stand out. And I've seen over and over again, if you do have that passion, you find a way in a door by hook or by crook. The person I told you about, cold application strategy, passion, incredible passion for the job family they're in, incredible passion for startups, for the particular space they were in, and they showed it every step of the way. You cannot fake passion. Clearly, can't make passion go out of style. And passion leads to problem solving, which is what you get paid to do in startups and tech. The function of compensation is to reward you to some degree for the scope of your impact in problem solving. That is true regardless of your job level. And so think about the problem space you can be sustainably curious about. It might be weird. It might not map exactly to a job family. Let that be okay for a minute. But I don't hear that get said enough. If you're not passionate about the problem space, it's not going to last. Another story that's totally at the opposite end that I'll share. This is someone who was considered widely to be unemployable. Not because they'd had a terrible scandal in their past, but because they were one of those square pegs and round holes. The experience set that they brought to the table did not neatly fit on any resume for a given job title. Is that you? You know folks like that? We've all had that moment. in that world. You know what that person did? They went out and they hyperargeted. They picked they they went through the same process I just laid out for targeting companies where you think about your values. You think about what your upside is going to be, what what your problem space you're going to be passionate about. And they found one company. They said, "I want to learn. My top value is learning. and I want to find a particular company and and I want to make sure that I learn this problem space really well and I want to tie in these particular pieces from my background. They had a whole thing great. Then they spent hours and hours and hours preparing an application strategy for just that company. It was like that company was the whole product for them. Like I I'm telling you it must have been 50 60 hours of work. It was a video. It was all kinds of stuff. And they went in with what I call a spear fishing strategy. And the point is not the individual tactics they used. The point is the passion they had for that company tied to that problem space tied to their role. And what they did is they went and said, "I don't care whether a particular job is open right now. I want this company so bad, right? I'm going to like go in and like spearfish and target it and show my value." Not everyone has that story. Not everyone has that background. Not everyone is suited for spear fishing. But spear fishing is a way to make progress in a world that is overwhelmed by cold AI applications. And I think there's really only three routes and we all know the third one. The third one is you have a cousin that works in the startup, right? You'reworked. You have a friend. You met someone at a cocktail party. And so I don't need to tell you how to work that one. You're either in the network or you're not. And if you're not in the network, frankly, moved to New York or San Francisco. Those are basically the two nodes of the network. that the only way if you're not living in those two cities to start to break into tech to start to get into the roles in tech that you're looking for is either to have the kind of incredible passion married with incredible grunt work and frankly tolerance for pain that goes with a cold application strategy nowadays and to go after that with heart and passion. make every single one your best and not give up for months and months and months and months and months and possibly years. Or to do the spear fishing approach where you go in and you hyperarget a company, you know, it's absolutely perfect for you and you put tens of hours into it and you make the video and you make a personal website for them and you do this and you do the other thing. You like maybe you're the one that sends like the special cake to them. I don't know. Like there's a dozen ways to do this. All of them are distinguished by being unique and creative and tied to the company. So there's no recipe for this. You have to use your own creativity and passion for the problem space to spearfish well. But that's the other option. You spearfish and that is the way people get roles. And what's interesting to me as I think about this in the context of artificial general intelligence is that AI does not have this kind of passion for a problem space. AI can do a lot of the individual activities. But I think it's fair to say that the thing that built the companies that are enduring in Silicon Valley today was passion for the problem space. I feel like I feel good saying Steve Jobs would agree with me on that one. He built Apple on passion. One of the biggest critiques right now of Apple is that they have run out of passion. Jonie IV has left. And so the thing that can distinguish you, the thing that stands out, not just you versus the AI, but you versus a sea of cold applications that didn't care and just sort of yeated their application in from LinkedIn on a single click. It's the passion. It's the passion for the problem space. And so as we wrap this up, what I want to challenge you with is one, pay more attention to your targeting. Think more about your riskreward and where you invest your time. And two, think about how you value problem spaces and the fact that you can't fake passion and then work your way into your application strategy from there. That is the best advice I can give. I don't see it very often on the internet and I want you to have it. Cheers.
