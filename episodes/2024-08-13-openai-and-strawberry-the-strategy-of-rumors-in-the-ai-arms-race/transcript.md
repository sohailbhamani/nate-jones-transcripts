# OpenAI and "Strawberry": The Strategy of Rumors in the AI Arms Race

large language models and the updates that they get are hard enough to understand without having a constant tension between the hype that these llm makers bring to the table and the actual product releases that they offer I was thinking about this because advanced voice mode which is something that has been widely hyped that has been released in a closed beta as of mid August 2024 is still not widely available even though it was discussed this spring shown this spring said to be super cool this spring by open AI Sora also by open AI is kind of in the same boat we still don't have widely available video generation from open AI even though they announced it even though they had a whole page dedicated to it what I find fascinating is that open AI is deliberately adopting a hype approach here that makes sense from a game theory perspective but is super frustrating to customers and they're not the only ones there are a lot of other model makers out there who are adopting a hype first approach and the ones that aren't it makes sense for them given their incentives let me walk through that sort of comparison quickly let's start with open AI they need attention to maintain Market leadership they need to be shown and seen to be the leaders in AI to keep their number one position in usage and that matters to them because even though they are very well funded by Microsoft they still need to show that they're number one for Microsoft to defend propose Drive Enterprise deals based on the open AI model set with very large companies which is key to Microsoft's overall monetization strategy and the way Microsoft is thinking about their open AI investment so they have to get attention and that means they have to be constantly seen as moving in the direction of significantly improved AI even if actual shipments to scaled out user Footprints lag way behind and that's what we're seeing that's why Sora is not really widely available yet that's why advanced voice mode is not widely available yet and that's why in the most recent hype example I don't think strawberry is going to be widely available for a while what is strawberry you might ask it is rumored or leaked to be the next iteration in reasoning and autonomous internet navigation from chat GPT the reason why they decided to leak it seems pretty clear to me it's a hype battle and I noticed that the strawberry leaks really gain speed and momentum after report started to drop that a lot of folks with open API pipelines by open I mean easy to switch out of large language models like if you're deploying an application you want to be able to switch an llm on the back end it's super easy well once llama released last month and once uh the latest uh version from anthropic Claude Sonet released there was a persistent push to start to shift those API pipelines over to other models not chat GPT because chat GPT was widely perceived as being lower on a significant range of benchmarks even their 40 model versus Sonet versus uh llama and as those reports began to circulate as it began to become apparent that people who build this space were moving away from open AI toward a more advanced model suddenly leaks began to multiply from open AI that hey we're working on something new it's called strawberry it's really cool and then yesterday August 12th it turns out that they've been releasing something in the wild in 40 for weeks and not telling anyone about it and they just sort of had a cryptic announcement to say hey we've got a new and improved 40 model in the wild it's been out there for a few weeks I hope you've been liking it that is not a release note that does not help someone who is trying to understand the wide latent space that you have in an llm capability set to actually use that space to do useful work it just doesn't work and we need release notes even if they're hard because we need guidance as users to start to figure out where to go next because the chat window doesn't really tell us anything I've talked about that in previous previous videos the the chat window just says say something and we have to understand enough of the llm to prompt appropriately and if I don't know that a model is upgraded and this is not just an open AI Problem by the way this is a larger industry problem with llms right now if I don't know what the capability set in the upgrade is it is hard for me to know how to change my usual prompting strategy to get more out of the upgrade so I don't necessarily perceive any value because the value is in the response to my prompt and my prompt will need to change if the latent space in the model has shifted if the capability space has adjusted so all of that to say yes there's rumors about a new release called strawberry I wanted to contextualize it in the larger sort of hype cycle and I wanted to call out as I close this video the difference between this approach and the way meta is handling things because I think meta exemplifies sort of the opposite take meta doesn't have the same set of incentives they are not trying to monit their model Mark Zuckerberg has been extremely clear about that and their only goal is to build an ecosystem which means their real value is if a real model is released widely so that people can build on it and that is why meta is shipping widely and letting researchers letting developers build against their models that's why llama when it was released was actually released not just announced because meta doesn't have the same need to maintain hype they just need to build an ecosystem that really works now I'm not here to say who's going to win this race if we step back I think one of the big concerns I have is that all of the players who see what is happening have decided that this is an important enough moment in history that they are willing to invest potentially billions of dollars over and that's not my take by the way that's actually from like Google memos that have been released that say that they're looking at it from a game theory perspective and saying we'd rather overinvestment deprecate super fast how do you win when the llm is out of date in 90 days and you've put so much into it and now people are talking about switching I remember it was just earlier this year when 40 was incredible and we were so excited for it and now sonnet is out and that's better in certain ways and llama's out and that's better in other ways and it's just going to keep happening this is not like the age of railroads where you could build train train track to a village and it was your train track and it was a durable investment and you could actually get the return on investment by monetizing it over an extended period of time we need to be in a place where you can get that kind of return on investment and right now what big companies are betting on is that they are going to get to that place later and they are willing to spend now on a insane pace of acceleration in l M intelligence until they get to a spot where they can establish a dominant Market position and start to monetize and so they're willing to do all of this throwaway work that essentially amounts to better cheaper intelligence for everybody which is great for consumers great for professionals who are trying to level up their work and they're willing to delay monetization that's going to have wide implications on the earnings reports of major companies over the next few years they are going to be willing to take hits on their earnings that are substantial that are material that are in the billions and billions of dollars tens of billions of dollars in order to show that they can win at this game because they think winning at the game of artificial intelligence is that important okay so if you want to understand like why I contextualize strawberry the way I do that's my take I think rumors like the strawberry rumor out of open AI need to be understood inside like a game theory frame inside an arms race frame so that you actually can see what each player is trying to do and not just look at the capabilities because so often the capabilities Trail way behind all right that's my take what do you think about strawberry
