# My Take on the Hard AI Questions: Jobs, Water, Artificial Romance, School Cheating & More

It's Thanksgiving in the US and this is a video all about how to talk about AI around the Thanksgiving table. I'm going to assume that like many Americans, you have people with a wide range of opinions on AI sitting down to have turkey together. Some of them may be very pro AI. Many of them may be suspicious of AI or not happy that AI is coming into the world or even actively hostile. What do you do? How do you have a positive conversation and not just say, "Let's pass the stuffing and change the subject." I wanted to go beyond just giving you suggested answers to common questions. Look, I know the questions cuz I get them, too. There are questions about water usage, about electricity usage, about cheating in schools, lots of other things. I wanted to actually go underneath, look at the psychology of persuasion and debate and think about why these questions are surfacing. So, we're going to reframe some of these key questions around a larger set of frameworks that help us to have productive discussions regardless of which question comes up. And if that sounds too abstract, it won't for long. We're going to start with a smarter framework called the moral foundations framework, which sounds fancy, but I'm not going into professor mode here. All this is is a theory that suggests that we argue about policies, but we're actually defending our deep moral intuitions. That's pretty intuitive. And so instead of defending technology when someone makes comments about AI, identify the moral foundation they're protecting and validate that first. So, if you catch someone telling you, "I think that kids are going to use Gemini 3 to fake their handwriting and cheat in schools." They're saying they value fairness. You can say, "I agree. I want a world where hard work matters, where kids learn in school, actual stuff that they have to work on with their brains. And I think we need to treat AI maybe like steroids in sports. It would be banned in competition, but maybe useful for training in specific ways." Let's think about how we can draw that line. That's a sample answer. You're going to have to decide exactly how you want to answer it. But my point is, if you think about why they're asking that, you're going to get farther around the Thanksgiving table. Let me give you another example. Let's say it's about fake art or fake writing. You know, it's like, this art isn't real art. I don't understand why people are so into mid Journey. Why can't they pay real artists? The value underneath that is purity, authenticity. I feel that, too, right? There's something sacred about the human wrestling and struggling to make art. The books that are written on my shelves were not written by Chat GPT. And so I look at AI less as an artist and more as a camera. A camera can capture an image instantly, but we still value a painting because of the human intent behind it. So AI might become a cheap photo, but human writing is still going to be valued like an oil painting. Again, you can decide how you want to tackle that, but my sense is if you let people know that they're valued and the things they care about are something you can agree on, you're going to get farther. Let me give you one more example here in this sort of framework of validating values. Let's say they fear job loss, right? That may be a care and protection value coming through. And you can say like, look, I I get it. It's scary to think about people getting left behind while the rich get richer, but I want to make sure that AI is actually out there in such a way that everyone can take advantage of it precisely so everyone can leverage it for their careers. It's not a perfect answer, but the point here is not perfect answers. And if you're having an honest conversation around the table, it opens the door to discussion. We're all in truth deciding on the future of AI together. That's part of why I have this show is I I talk about where we're going and we learn together as we go. In the same way, we can learn together around the Thanksgiving table how to talk. Let me give you another framework. Maybe this one will help instead. Maybe the values one isn't for you. Augmentation versus automation. So, a lot of fear comes from the idea that AI is a onetoone replacement for a human. If that is at the root of what's going on, there's definitely ways that you can talk about it. So, let's give you a specific example. Let's say they're worried about a robot doctor. The robot doctor is a classic example of of automation instead of augmentation, right? And you can say, "Look, I I don't want a robot doctor either, but I do want my human doctor to make the best diagnosis possible, and I know that AI can help with that. I know that AI can actually give suggestions that are useful. We've seen those studies. And so I think of AI more as an Iron Man suit and less as a full automation solution. See how that sort of reframes from automation to augmentation. Another one, it might be a scarcity versus abundance conversation. A lot of objections are implicitly based in this idea of scarcity. There's not enough to go around. Let's say maybe electricity and water. So, one way you could answer that if someone asks about electricity or water is to say, well, you know, to be honest, AI should be treated like any other industry and perhaps graded harder because of the investment that is being made in it. It shouldn't get a free pass. But when I looked at it, water, we lose more water, like a lot more water just from the internal dripping of faucets and leaking inside our homes in American houses than we do to AI data centers. Water at golf courses is a much much bigger issue than water in data centers. And yes, electricity is a major issue and we need to make sure that we plan for it. But that would be true for any industry. It just happens to be true for AI as well. And so I think the most productive thing to do is to hold AI to the standard we would hold any other industry and to stop maybe comparing AI to an individual home's consumption of anything. Because it turns out that when you think of AI as what it is, an industry, you get a sense of whether the abundance and the value that it provides is worth the cost. And it's difficult to do that if you're just trying to compare it to like one household's electricity consumption and saying it's x thousand households or something. That's not super practical. Another one that might get it scarcity versus abundance, tutoring, education. Right now, tutoring is really scarce. Only rich kids get tutoring. But if AI works, we could work to a move to a world where personal attention and education isn't scarce anymore. It's abundant. Anyone can have it. And every kid would get a tutor. And that's messy right now. It's not perfect, but that's the kind of world that we're on the threshold of, and that's what makes me excited. I'll give you one more framework, the beta tester framework. Relatives will often judge AI by the fact that it's currently glitchy or it hallucinates. It's sort of important to remind them that we are in the clunky prototype phase right now. So, judging AI by where chat GPT was last year is like judging the internet by a dialup modem in 1994. It's annoying. It's slow. It cuts out when you need it. But we're not talking about keeping this version forever. In fact, we're evolving the version all the time and that most of the people who talk about it this way haven't tried the latest model. They haven't tried Gemini 3. They may not have tried Nano Banana Pro. And so some of the claims that they make based on the idea that it's always going to be this way, that it's just always going to be stuck in beta. And one of the things we can share is that it's it's changing really fast, right? Like it's growing really fast. If this video has seemed a little bit scattered, I'm going to tell you something. I did that on purpose because Thanksgiving conversations are a little bit scattered, too. They tend to bat around, bat back and forth. I want you to be equipped with a mental backpack, a sense of how to reframe, how to have talk tracks around AI that are more productive. And the goal, at least my personal goal, I don't need to win converts for AI. I don't need to convince anybody. I don't need to say AI is the best thing since sliced bread. That's fine. I don't I don't need any of that. But I would love it if someone opened up their mind and was willing to approach AI with curiosity. That's it. That's all I'm looking for. And so when I sit down and I talk and I have relatives who are have feelings about AI, too. I know that might be hard to believe, but it's true. That's my goal. My goal is to have a conversation, use some of these framework approaches to validate what they're looking at and what they're concerned about and then maybe nudge toward curiosity as well as educating with some facts because the truth is if you follow AI, you know AI has progressed really really rapidly since last year. The things that were true even 6 months ago aren't true now. If you follow AI, you know that the claims around water and electricity are often extremely inflated by the media and not helpfully framed. And I did a little bit of a job framing that for you. And that's similar to the jobs thing. And I think that one of the things that we can be honest about is that the storytelling around AI has been largely by people who don't know AI. Most of the journalists, and in fact, some of them tell me this privately, they don't understand AI and they're fearful of it. that's not really the right person to tell the public what AI is. And so, if you're trying to figure out how to tell the story around the Thanksgiving table or at least answer with the mashed potatoes, I hope this video is helpful. If you want to send them to my YouTube channel, you can send them to my YouTube channel. I'm happy to sort of be the voice in the room if that's helpful for you. But really, maybe just pull out Gemini and have some fun. Pull out Chad GPT, have some fun. Pull out Claude, have some fun. Find something that makes the family gathering feel more traditional, more like it should, more authentic. And if AI can reinforce that, great. Maybe AI can help you with the family trivia game this year. Maybe AI can help you with the thank you cards. Maybe AI can help you with the menu planning. There's a lot of different ways to do it, but don't let don't let those demonstrations feel out of character for Thanksgiving. do the work to make them feel like they're just part of the holiday because I think that we're at our best in these situations when we just let AI be what it is, which is intelligence that's pretty cool and it has some use. So there you go. That's my two cents. That's how I'm kind of thinking about approaching Thanksgiving. If you have difficult relatives, difficult neighbors who are really struggling with AI, they probably have good reasons for that. And I think that that's one of the things that is hard to remember. And that's one of the things I wanted to call out with these frameworks is the frameworks are all based on the assumption that these people have really good reasons for thinking the way they do and we should respect those first before we jump in and just talk about what we want to talk about with AI. So there you go. Listen, pass the mashed potatoes. See if you can get them to be curious about AI just just a little bit. Cheers.
