# Product Strategy in the Age of AI: What We Can Learn from Lovable.dev

we need to talk about product strategy in the age of intelligence because it's different now and I'm going to use a specific example from today where a new app came out that is going to displace the llm to code Market I'm calling it now so lovable dodev finally dropped on product hunt I've followed it for a little bit and I tried it as soon as it came out I gave it the same prompt that I'd seen bolt struggle with because you want AAL with some difficult right and this thing zero shotted the entire classic game of pong in 90 seconds with a five-word prompt I have never seen that from an llm to code application and it got me thinking I am obviously as a consumer super excited about this I know a lot of people who are getting into the building space who need continual progression in the quality of these apps in order to successfully Bridge their current on technical skill set into a technical skill set but if you're an app builder this is a really tough place to be in because you can go from one day to the next and all of a sudden you're second or third or fourth place just because someone else figured out some tweak in the model somewhere and it can now infer better from vague prompts it can now infer World modeling better that was one of the things that I noticed with the pong game with lovable it got the right Ang Les correct and the bouncing correct that you get with a classic game of pong and bolt just couldn't do that I kept prompting and repr prompting and just never figured it out I gave bolt GitHub code from a working HTML and JavaScript version of pong it still didn't figure it out so this is one of those things where I have a lot of sympathy if you're in the building space the only way that it really works in the age of intelligence to build product is is to release quickly and demonstrate through releasing quickly that you have a phenomenal commitment to giving your customers the latest intelligence so that you earn their loyalty when something new and flashy comes along and I will give credit to bold here one of the things that they've done really well at is relentlessly improving since that initial launch I guess it was a couple of months ago one of the things in particular that they've noted and improved on is the ability to fix bugs now that wasn't my experience with pong but I have worked with other web apps with bolt and it's worked really well and I think that if you are going to be building in the intelligence space you need to commit to continual Improvement we see the continual improvement from model makers there's right now a Leap Frog competition for the weekly model updates between Claude and Gemini at the top of the model boards every week it seems to switch around and the point there is that most people think of these numbered models as static and the reality is behind the scenes they're getting smarter every day the original Chad gp4 ranks almost at 100 on the model boards now and we're still using Chad GPT 4 but it's been updated almost weekly ever since and it's just so much better as it results I ran a simulation in Claude around this idea of velocity driving value and I think it's a really interesting result so what I did was I took three different scenarios for a product team I had releasing monthly releasing bi-weekly and I had releasing every three days and I thought to myself well if you're releasing at these different cadences your probability of success will change because you have less time to learn and so you can have say a 5% probability of ESS if you're releasing every 3 days 10% if you release every two weeks 20% if you release every month and I thought okay like intuitively these things are going to kind of even out a little bit we'll give them the same reward but like they hit the reward less often if you ship more frequently I think the frequent shipping wins I don't know that it wins by a lot I was surprised so when you actually graph it out monthly and bi-weekly look almost the same same in terms of reward accumulation over a year and by reward accumulation I mean imagine that your monthly ship is at a 20% probability and you get a 100 bucks if it comes up positive and you get nothing if it comes up negative and you just repeat that exercise over the course of the year you have 12 shots on goal by weekly you have 24 Shots on goal roughly 26 24 anyway this is why I have CLA do the math and then every three days there's many more shots on gold than that but they're lower probability so long story short everybody makes progress but only shipping insanely fast every 3 days results in significant accumulation shipping every 3 days was three times more valuable than both shipping by week by by bi-weekly and shipping monthly it was a stunning difference and this is coming back around to what I'm saying with the value of shipping strategically in a model Builder's world you have to be able to ship quickly to earn the trust of your customers there is no substitute there's no other way around it and if you're not shipping quickly people are going to do what I did they're going to go to lovable. deev and their eyes are going to get really big and they won't come back because this new thing has promised them something and I think that's actually a situation where the pendulum may eventually switch back but I wouldn't bet on you being around to get there if you wait on that and what I mean is the pendulum right now is swung over toward impatience and high experimentation value because of the hype around AI but people aren't finishing their projects most AI start projects never get to production like 90 some per never reach production so people are just always in this learning moment and the Pendulum hasn't swung back back to Value shipping executing and delivering and that takes more sustained detention in one app that breeds customer loyalty and we may yet see that loyalty Trend come back and become a Tailwind but I don't know when it's going to shift and I wouldn't wait around for it and in the meantime the only thing you can do is ship very quickly all right best of luck and try lovable. Dev it's fun
