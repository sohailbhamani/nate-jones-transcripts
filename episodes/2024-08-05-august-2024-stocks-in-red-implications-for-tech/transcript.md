# August 2024: Stocks in Red, Implications for Tech

it's Monday August 5th and I want to explain to you why everyone is throwing up their hands and panicking about the stock market in the US there's three key drivers here and it's all coming together and I want to explain what's going on and then also explain the implications for Tech so here's the drivers number one is what we call the Yen carry trade I actually lived through the first instance when this became un stock in 1998 in Asia it's a very vivid memory for me it's a really big deal when this gets unstuck so brief history since 1990 about the Japanese government has maintained broadly speaking about a 0% interest rate on the Yen and the reason for that is because they want to reinl the economy and so Japanese interest rates have been so low for so long that institutional investors have taken to borrowing in Yen because it's essentially risk-free money at their scale and investing in US equities and arbitraging the difference so there's a lot of buying pressure coming from that trade for a very long time is really consistent and when it comes unstuck is basically when the Japanese government decides to raise interest rates which it has once or twice it did in 1998 and it did this week in fact it was an unexpectedly sharp rise which is part of what's driving people up the wall right now about $4 trillion dollar in US equities are attached to this Japanese Yen carry trade thing it starting to get Unwound as Traders have to go back and make sure they can cover their losses because at the end of the day there's a there's a double Dynamic here when the interest rates rise it's not only not risk-free anymore it is also increasing the value of the Yen it's appreciating the currency so if you're handling multicurrency swaps it means that you're potentially unable to sell your us equities position and cover all of your Yen debt because the Yen's worth more now relative to the dollar that probably sounded really complicated it is one of the pieces here's the other two briefly uh the AI capex problem which I have talked about on this channel Affair bit fundamentally we're spending a ton of money on Capital expenses for AI but the return on investment window is way longer than the street wants it is not 12 to 18 months it's going to be years out and that's not me saying that that's big corporations saying that in their earnings reports and that is scaring the market that was really hoping that AI would produce an earlier boost to earnings and instead they're sing it produce an earlier boost to Capital expenditures on the wrong side of the balance sheet all right and then the third Factor no surprise election year things tend to be really dramatic the geopolitical situation uh right now is very unstable as well and so that just adds to a sense of uncertainty when you put all three of these things together and then you sort of light the Tinder with uh this unexpected interest rate rise from the bank of Japan things get exciting really quickly and that is exactly what happened over the weekend and that is why uh most people are expecting that this week in the equities markets is going to be really red so what does that mean for the IPO window for the exit window for Tech in general so I I'd like to divide this up into a couple of of maybe three different takeaways one for Broad tech which is like Tech outside of the really big tech companies like if you work in Tech at Walmart one is uh around how we understand the tech startup market and exits and the last one is for big Tech in particular all right so broadtech first in general the thing if you work in broadtech like if you're an IT support at a bank if you're a product manager who is working with a large retail company that isn't a tech company these things matter less than the larger signals in the economy around whether or not the economy has headed into recession and right now those lights are flashing yellow we don't really know what's going to happen we typically learn about whether we're in a recession after we're already in it which is part of what makes people nervous so if you're looking at what is going to drive your Equity package look at the broader economic signals because that is what's going to be most influential for the earnings and revenue for your particular company now if you're in startups this whole uncertainty window all of the red in the markets this week probably is going to make it even harder to plan for a exit now that won't matter if you're seed stage if you're series a you don't really care you're way too far out from an exit for it to matter but if you are series C or later and you were thinking about a particular three or four four month window three to six-month window for exiting this is probably going to shift that timeline out which means the value of your Equity is going to shift out as well that is something I have seen over and over and over again since the shift in the markets in 2022 and I think one of the things I am looking for to see if tech is getting back to healthy is if late stage companies can reasonably plan for exits because right now that has just not been the case for a couple of years and it's sticking up the markets overall finally for big Tech if you have equity in big Tech it's a tough time so long story short basically big Tech is getting pummeled from two directions at once uh the invest in equities that the Yen carry trade unlocked and sort of a lot of the institutional buying in the market May turn into some degree of selling over the next week it's just not going to be a good time for a week or two here and when you have broader concerns around recession that are also starting to pop their heads up and concerns around Capital expenditures at the very companies where you own Equity it adds up to a really challenging combination I'm not here to tell you what to do but I would say say this is one of those times where you have to have a long-term view of the value of your career and the value that you're unlocking and sort of where your equities can go long term because in the short term I don't think that things are going to look very pretty at some of these big tech companies none of them are necessarily strangers to draw down so if you look back at the history of say Amazon or Netflix or other big companies they will have these big draw Downs it's happened before this it may happen again we'll see uh but keep in mind that overall what you're doing when you work at a company is you're making a bet on that company's long-term future and just remember the longterm right now remember the long-term future you're looking to unlock because things will probably get rough this week and that hopefully you understand why now hopefully you understand the implications for attack I'm really looking for a little bit more predictability in the markets in 2025 to unlock that late stage IPO window and I think that's going to help things out it will also help if in 2025 we can get some of these big companies saying they're starting to see Revenue coming in from AI those two factors would be huge all right best of luck this week
