# Myths of software development: 3 myths that hold back PM & engineering teams plus what matters most

what is the number one most costly thing that you can do with your engineers if you're in product management or frankly if you're an engineering leader what's the most costly thing that you can do with your engineering team we're going to talk about that today and we're going to dispel some common myths that people spread pretty widely around Tech around what is the most expensive uh or costly thing that you can do that wastes engineering team time and talent number one this is a we're going through the myths first we'll get to the thing that that is the actual cost C at the end so the first myth it's it's incorrect to say that building and releasing an imperfect version of your product is the most costly mistake that you can make with your engineering team that's just not true and part of the reason why that's not true is that oftentimes you want to be deliberately imperfect so that you can trade off and get to Market faster so there's that whole conversation around what a minimum viable product looks like and how minimum is to minimum I'm not going to get into that whole discussion today but I did want to call out if you're thinking about the highest and best use for your engineering team you want to be thinking about products in terms of an elastic time constraint so that you can say this is the correct amount of time to spend on this product for the risk and the reward that we're looking at and that can include shipping imperfect product that's not necessarily a waste of your engineering teams time and if you hear otherwise that's a myth it's myth number one myth number two is the opposite it's it's a two perfect version and I do hear people who love the idea of an MVP saying that the worst thing you can do with your engineering team is to spend too much time on the product and to make it too perfect and too polished I don't think that's always true I think it's sometimes true just like a lot of things in product it depends on the context for example if you're trying to solve a problem that needs to be all the way solved before it's solved at all you're going to need to polish the edges uh a great example of that is the iPhone was released in a fairly polished State even in version one and I know we look back on that now from the perspective of like our iPhone 15 over here or whatever it is and we say I cannot even imagine being in 2007 and calling that phone polished but at the time it was polished I'll give you a different example that's not Apple if you are trying to solve the problem of uh drone delivery I heard a good talk on this actually when I was at Amazon you need to be sure that your drones will never ever ever fall out of the Sky because the cost of that would be killing a customer and that's way too expensive you can't ever afford that that's never acceptable and so you have to solve the problem of safe flight and safe package delivery completely before you release it all and so it would be incorrect in that context to say you're wasting your energy by spending too much time perfecting the product because you're not wasting it because that's the bar of the product demands I'm going to make a second point though here that is rarely made and that I want to stand behind it is also true that the most wasteful thing you can do with your engineering team is not is not to over perfect a product that you could have released sooner that's still not a great thing to do so if you are in a world where you can release a scrappy minimum viable product and those things do exist not everything is high stakes like drone delivery great maybe you're releasing a sort of a small proof of concept piece of software it maybe you spent too much time on it with your engineers that's not a great choice it's still not your worst choice and we're here today looking for your worst Choice as an engineering manager or engineering leader because I think understanding that helps you understand where you can put your time most and this goes for product okay so if you if you spend your time on creating imperfect versions of things that's not the worst thing you can do if you spend your time creating two perfect versions of things that's myth number two that's still not the worst thing you can do and the reason why is neither of those things play with the core risk factor involved those are all playing with engineering time as the key risk factor and that is a false Assumption of risk your biggest expense here is not the cost of your engineers and people assume it is and so when they talk about you built it to imperfectly now the engineers will have to go back and do it again it still translates to engineering time as the basic unit of economics if it's too perfect it goes back to engineering time as the basic unit unit of Economics it's based on a full flaw assumption because at the end of the day engineering cost is not the biggest risk risk factor for your business and I'm going to give you one more example on the engineering cost fallacy so the third one that people often do is they say Engineers need to maximize the time they spend on keyboard and not planning and thinking right there's this assumption if the engineers aren't producing code they're not doing work and anyone who's worked in engineering will tell you that that doesn't make any sense at all but Business Leaders sometimes make that assumption and sadly product managers will sometimes along with that is absolutely not a mistake a problem something that needs to be corrected engineering thinking and planning before they go into coding is actually a great choice and so this is one of those things where there's not really in my mind much of a debate you want to make sure you have time for your engineers to think and plan carefully but people do because they think of engineering cost as time it takes to produce lines of code assume that you have to have your engineer sort of maximizing the number of lines of code out and any engineer will tell you it's actually not the number of lines that you want to maximize it's the efficiency and elegance of the system and the way it's able to solve problem and so we have this factory production mindset that has crept in from frankly the 19th century and the early 20th century when we did assembly lines where we assume that Engineers are workers on assembly lines mentally and therefore they need to be working to make code all the time and the core cost that we're dealing with is like how quickly can they turn out the code and is the code the right quality and that factory mindset underlies all three of these that's what we talk about and think about when we say this time unit cost of engineering as our biggest risk factor I want you to take that whole mental model and just put it to the side it's not super helpful in actually understanding the real cost because at the end of the day that is the wrong mental model to understand software software is not a factory you do not make software on an assembly line like that instead software is a series of bets that you're playing on how you can assess product Market fit using software and if you get the BET right software gives you tremendous leverage to unlock that value farther and that's why software isn't like factories because it's not like you're making five different kinds of cars and you can make a thousand of them cheaply as soon as you get one to work you're actually committing to a production run and you're making them linearly when you're dealing with physical goods and physical products I've had to do that but with software it's actually really elegant and really easy to make these uh thesis or bets and see if they fit and that brings me to the part that is the biggest cost what is the biggest cost for your engineering team in a world where you actually understand how software is made in the unit economics of software it's aiming incorrectly it is producing bad thesis or bad bets that you will then follow up and have to spend time on when you shouldn't be spending time on the BET in the first place and that is why product is such a high leverage higher because at the end of the day a product manager's job is not to make bad bets they need to make bets that are as high quality as possible that doesn't mean you expect every single one of them to work but it does mean that you expect them to be in a direction of a learning Loop really deliberate as high quality as possible grounded in customer as much as possible and that you expect the product manager to be able to learn and adapt quickly and so when you're hiring for PMS that's what you're looking for and when you're looking at the cost to your engineering team you're looking to basically say is the engineering team spending their time on the right bets and so in a sense the value of the engineering team is contingent on the value of product Direction and whether or not you get your product direction from a product manager or from an engineering leader or from your CEO that's still the fundamental question are you putting your engineering team against the right bets because each bet you start is like a little thread across an unknown landscape and if you start that thread just the motion of momentum tends to carry you forward on that thread and you will put inordinate effort into trying to prove out that thread going forward it will take you longer than you expect to stop longer than you expect to release fast follow features that's just the way software works so you better get where you want to start right and that's the key risk if you are bad at pick in where you want to start at exploring what I would call a latent space for product where you're trying to figure out whether the product fits or not if you pick incorrectly if you frame the problem wrong if you pick the choice of features for your MVP set so you're not actually learning something that's going to be a problem that's a bet that you can't take back very easily that's something that's going to be very expensive because your entire effort from your engineering team would be poorly poorly in tested and poorly chosen from day one like it doesn't even matter if it kind of works if you frame the problem badly enough it won't be scalable in a sense it is possible to get your engineering team going in a direction where it will take months to unwind whatever you do you will learn nothing and your bet will be wrong from the GetGo and I have seen that happen and that that is the actual risk of how you waste time with engineers and it's not just product managers that do that I've seen business leadership do that sometimes I've seen enging leaders do it and if you understand how software Works getting your engineers focused on the wrong bets is the number one biggest risk you can you can face so make sure that you are betting correctly and that is probably a separate video we'll do a separate conversation on how you aim or how you set up your bets correctly but I wanted to call out those myths because a lot of people think oh it's about over perfecting your product that's the most expensive thing you can do with Engineers no it's or it's about under perfecting the product you're releasing a flawed product that's the most expensive thing you can do because you'll have to to rework again no unit cost is not the problem and unit cost is also not the problem when your engineers take time to think which is the third major myth none of those are really the issue because factory models of production for software are a flawed mental model software is about bets and the core value that you have is making the right bet and it follows that the core risk that you take is making the wrong bet that is the most expensive thing you can do with your engineering team and I recommend not doing it let me know if you have any uh bad bats or good bats that you want to chat about in the comments uh cheers
