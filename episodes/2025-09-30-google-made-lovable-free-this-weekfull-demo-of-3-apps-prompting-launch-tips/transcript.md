# Google Made Lovable FREE This Week—Full Demo of 3 Apps + Prompting & Launch Tips

If you are wondering when is the right time to try this whole vibe coding thing or when should I try my next project that I've been wanting to work on that's vibecoded now is the time. One, now is the time because it's always better than tomorrow from a startup perspective. That's just the entrepreneur in me. But two, now is specifically the time because lovable launched a set of tools that make it extraordinarily easy to build this week and they're partnering with Google to make vibe coding free this week. So, it's an extraordinary week to build. It's especially good because a lot of the tools aren't familiar to everyone in the building world yet if you're vibe coding. And also because Google being free means it's really easy to bring in the nano banana image editor and generator for your tools and applications. And that's a whole new set of capabilities that other builders haven't had access to through Lovable yet. So, what did Lovable launch and why does it matter? Fundamentally, one of the hardest things about vibe coding for the first 6 months of 2025 has been that it's really easy to get a goodlooking website that's a brochure site, like it's a homepage, it looks very nice, but you can't get the interactivity that you want to build a real business against it, right? Even if it's a side business, even if it's a small tool, even if it's a back-end tool for your your business, right? Some people are building backend tools in Lovable. The reason why it's been hard is because backend functionality has been foreign to lovable. They had a superbase integration that you could use for databases. They've been working on getting Stripe integrated. They've been working on users, but it's always been a series of integrations and you've had to work really hard to get all of those integrations to play ball with lovable to build a functioning app. People have persisted. People have built amazing apps in Lovable in the first half of 2025. And there are apps that have hit a million-dollar run rates built off Lovable. It's real. It happens. It exists. But it got a lot easier this week. You can now build directly on Lovable all the way through end to end. You can do your user roles on Lovable. You can get your domain on Lovable. You can get your uh complete backend and user management handled on Love Lovable. All of the login, all of the authentication handled on lovable. The only thing you need is the ability to integrate Stripe to collect payments. But Lovable makes that super easy. You enter a sort of secret key and you can do that securely in Lovable's interface and you're done. And so it has never been easier to actually build something that's useful. But I don't want to overstate the case. You should not hear this and think it is now possible to build Salesforce on lovable. No one's going to do that. There's a difference between the complexity and data scale required for enterprise software and the kinds of tools you can build for personal software for small team use in Lovable. None of that is to say that Lovable isn't useful. I would actually argue it's more useful than a lot of the classic enterprise software providers because it's so flexible. You can build so many different things and you can come back and do it again and again. I have probably more than 20 projects in Lovable at this point. All of them are interesting to me for different reasons. And what I'm going to do here in a moment is I'm going to show you a couple of the ones that I spun up today to give you a sense of where vibe coding is at and how quickly it has progressed in just the last few months. It is so so much easier to get lovable to understand what you want, to get lovable to build what you're looking for the first time and to get something that actually looks good. Are you still going to have to put in, you know, some weekend hours and work to get a functioning app that you're ready to ship? Yeah, you are. And I've written up a post about how to do that. And it's absolutely doable. Is it worth it? It absolutely is. If you've ever had a dream, I can have a side gig. I can have recurring income. Or I can be a consultant and put up a great site that actually helps me to scale my business. Or, hey, I don't want to leave my job. I don't want a side gig, but I want to build a tool that helps my team be more effective at work. Lovable is positioned to answer all of those things because what it provides is digital leverage. It provides the ability to code to anyone who wants to at a simple architectural level. It's not going to give you as much flexibility as you would have if you were in claude code or if you were in codeex as an engineer, but for most people, they don't need that. It's sort of like the difference between cooking at home and going to the restaurant. If you want to go to the restaurant and you want to order from a chef, that's great. You don't have to cook at that level at home. We have been missing the equivalent of home cooking and software. We now have it. And the reason I'm talking about Lovable specifically instead of about the whole family of vibe coding apps is that Lovable has distinguished itself very rapidly in a crowded field by shipping quickly and obsessing over value to Vibe coders. Other apps are playing catch-up at this point. Other apps don't have the range of functionality that the Lovable team has built in. And Lovable continues to ship quickly. So you're betting not just on its capabilities today. You're betting on what it can be tomorrow, what it can be next week, what it can be in two weeks. And I'm not kidding, they ship like every two weeks. Like, you're going to get a better app all the time. So, without further ado, let's look at a few things that I put together with real prompts today in Lovable and give you a sense of how it works, how easy it is, where the limitations are, kind of put some meat on the bones as far as understanding how this thing actually goes. So, the first one I want to share is a little bit self-referential. I actually asked Lovable to introduce itself. And what I love is that it actually put together a mini site illustrating what it could do. This is all an image, right? You can tell it's an image because it kind of has some of this like classic image craft that you get with LLMs these days. You can clean that up with your own image. But it introduces what it thinks it can do, right? Habit trackers, CRM, content generators, e-commerce MVPs, build really fast. It talks about the number of daily projects and how quick it is to get to an MVP. It really is just a few minutes to an MVP depending on how simple it is. Um, it talks about some recent things that are happening. Uh, lovable cloud and AI vibe coding takes over X and Reddit. Now, you might be wondering, how did I get it to make this handy little site that sort of talks about what lovable is? Like, how hard is that? Well, the answer is it's super easy. All I had to do was I had to say, hey, can you make me a site that talks about lovable? I then looked through it. It made a site. I liked it. Uh, and then you can see I was like, "Wait a minute. This is mostly 2024. You're not searching the web." Because of course that's not what Lovable is designed to do. So I said, "Okay, great. Please refine this with context." And I just pulled some context on the recent uh launch out of Perplexity. I pasted it in super quickly. And I honestly, this is just research context. This is not sort of requirements. This is just me saying these are things that lovable has launched. And then I told Lovable to make sense of it, and Lovable refined it and built a site. So, I think what's interesting here is that I didn't have to give it a clean research set to get some usable design. Like, this is very consumable and I could easily turn this into something that was useful for everyone very, very quickly. It's a nice little brochure site, but we're not just here for brochure sites. So, let's see what else Lovable can do. I think this one's really fun because it gets at this idea that you can do some like actual small business stuff. So, this is an idea for a business that really tracks food truck routes and gets at how you can start to route plan for food trucks in ways that make you more money, right? Like what are your what are your analytics per stop? How can you think about where you plan your routes accordingly and it's super simple, right? And I asked for it to be simple. I didn't want it to be complicated. Um, and I asked for it to be mobile first. And you can see this is designed to scale to mobile first very, very easily. Like if I compress it, you can see that Lovable has taken care of compressing it down to mobile first. Lovable then gives me a chance to refine and customize. I can say, for example, uh, please connect Lovable Cloud, which is their new capability, and I can just enable that super easy. And Lovable is just going to start to spin up the cloud side of things. And that's going to spin up a backend. So I can actually track multiple food trucks and develop a user base. And so this is telling you sort of what it can do. Um, I can select ask each time or not. I can allow or disallow. I'm going to allow this and it's going to keep going. So, I think this is an example of a very simple app that has some backend potential. Let's get a little more complex. This is one where I actually wanted to do a more sophisticated business idea and lay out an entire business focused on helping people set up and manage escape rooms. Escape rooms are a big hot trend, etc. What can we do to get onto that trend and build something useful? So, you'll notice first of all, Lovable comes up with a much more interesting overall layout. Uh, I had a prompt that I built in Perplexity. Actually, I think Perplexity understands Lovable's best print best practice prompting principles. So, I was able to build what's called a clear prompt, a prompt that has all the structure that that the system needs, and it's able to actually articulate all of this stuff that it wants me to have in one big prompt initially. And Lovable gets the general idea, right? It says, "I'll create a modern escape room platform with professional design, drawing inspiration from platforms like Countly and modern SAS dashboards, etc." Keeps going. What I want you to notice is that it eventually figures out it needs to hook in a booking calendar. It needs to figure it figures out it needs to add cloud and then it figures out that it needs to have all of these systems, right? The database, authentication, storage for room photos. It's figuring this out largely itself from the initial prompt and just asking me to connect in. I then ask about payments. You can see this is where I could add a Stripe key. Um, and then I ask about users and it says, "No, we don't have user authentication yet. You know, what should we add?" And I give it sort of an example that I put together. I worked with Claude Sonnet 4.5 to design this. And honestly, all I did was I took a screenshot of this section of the site down here and I said, "Hey, you get the idea, right? Like I have a starter, a professional in enterprise. I need roles." And it came up with roles for me. And I was like, "These look good." And so I threw it in and I said, "Okay, now start to build out roles." And it started to build out roles. Um, it's starting to fix on its own the security warnings. It's modifying the codebase. All I'm doing at this point is letting it build. Now, I'm not done yet, right? You'll notice I didn't add the stripe pricing. there would need to be a lot more fine-tuned comb work with the landing page until I was happy with it. Um, but it's actually not that difficult to do. Like you can hit edit here and then you can select an element you want to edit and say, "Hey, uh, change this to make it more uh attractive uh to prospects, right?" And then I can just it will come up with an alternate headline for that particular for that particular element. And you can adjust those elements as you go. It has never ever ever been this easy to build, guys. In 20 years of building, I have never seen anything this easy. I've been waiting. There you go. Just filled in the headline. I've been waiting to do a lovable piece until I saw a moment when it made sense. This is that moment. This is the moment when it makes sense to jump into lovable if you haven't already. It is astonishing how fast that team is making progress. It's amazing that we're actually able to get a full backend right there. I didn't have to connect to Superbase, which is the database Lovable has had to use for the last 6 months, 8 months, which was already cool. I didn't have to do that. Lovable Cloud took care of it. It just took care of it. It magically happened. It took care of the user roles. I didn't have to worry about whether I was in GitHub, right? Like you used to have to do that because it was code. And like if you're a non-coder, GitHub is scary. This is a moment when the tools for creating software leverage are ahead of the people. If you want to be one of those people that knows how to use software to create leverage for yourself, whether that's a side gig or whether that's tools for work or what have you, now is the moment. Now is the time you jump in because you have extraordinary opportunity to build something that's really meaningful that gets some traction in your specific niche. And if I can close with a few words of wisdom as a builder, as a founder, as an entrepreneur, number one, stick in your niche. You know your users. You know your customers. You are one of your customers. You know the problem space. Whatever it is that you know. Maybe it's not food trucks. Maybe it's not Legos. Maybe it's something else. But stick with the niche you know because you're going to be able to build much more useful products. That's true if you're a consultant as well. Look at the domain experience that you have in AI. Number two, don't be afraid to launch something that isn't perfect. Product market fit is surprisingly coarse grained. It is not perfect. It is just good enough. If you have product market fit, you will know because people will be clamoring to sign up for your product no matter what. Even if it's not fully perfect, even if there's issues with it, even if your funnel isn't all the way baked out. I see so many people who are new to building who hesitate, who wait, who want to plan, who say, "Well, I'll go when Lovable has integrated payments. It's not it's not ready yet. Lovable hasn't done payments." Action beats waiting. Action beats planning. Action beats everything else because it enables you to go faster and to iterate and to build as you go. The third thing that I would call out is that you now have the possibility to think in bets the way an entrepreneur does. Even if you don't think of yourself as a full-time entrepreneur, it is still a good career resilience habit to think in bets. This is something that Peter Levelvels popularized from a soloreneur perspective a few years ago, but thanks to tools like lovable, anybody can do it. You can now go and say, I don't know what's going to work. I'm going to put five or six different lovable prototypes out there that are related to my passion, my domain, and interest, and I'm going to see how it goes. And you guys saw the process, right? This is not that hard. You can just literally go into perplexity or into claude and you can say or into chat GPT and you can say hey following clear prompt principles I want to build this thing that's a small business right you describe what it is please prepare a prompt for lovable using best practice for lovable's documentation and off you go now I'm going to prepare some sample prompts to get you started I'll include some of the prompts that I showed you today and so you can actually see what it looks like and get ahead but it's not that hard it's totally doable and especially with Google giving everybody a free week of building. This is a great week to try it. So, if you've been wondering if the water is warm as a vibe coder, the water's warm, the surf is great. Hop in and start vibe coding. Cheers.
