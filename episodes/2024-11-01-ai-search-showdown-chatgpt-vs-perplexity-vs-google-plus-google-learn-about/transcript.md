# AI Search Showdown: ChatGPT vs. Perplexity vs. Google plus Google Learn About

Chad GPT made a really big deal out of launching search this week and I wanted to see what it was all about I wanted to test it against perplexity I wanted to test it against Google I wanted to see what was actually going to provide useful information I wanted to use a real query and I wanted to use one that I think would be more plausibly useful for a wider range of users versus something that is extremely high intent and specific by which I mean I'm not going to look up the meaning of Hyperdimension space in llms I'm going to look up where are the Huskies playing this weekend so that's what I did I looked up where are the Huskies playing this weekend I did it in Chad gpt's Chrome extension I did it in CAD gpt's app I did it in perplexities app and I did it in Google and I went through and I looked at the lag I went through and looked at the quality of the results and I went through and looked at how easy it was to scan and get the meaning back out so let me give you a breakdown chat GPT first they are very excited about their search and you know Sam Alman himself claimed he now uses chat GPT twice as much because of search I tried it both in the Chrome extension and in the app and got basically the same experience I did not see a difference in time and what I saw was around a 1 second query response time for something like where the Husky's playing this weekend and that is long enough to be noticeably lagged so you think one second is fast when I tell it to you but in the world of search it's slow it then came back with a very short one sentence response that was accurate it directly answered my question the huskys are playing at home this weekend right like it was very clear now what wasn't helpful is that it was not scannable I had to read the entire sentence to get the information out and again you might think well you're being lazy like you should read the sentence to get the information out but if you think about it Google has actually trained us not to do that and so we'll get to that when we talk about Google search result but perplexity next perplexity is another Aid driven search engine and theirs took even longer than chat gpts to the same exact queries where are the huskys playing so perplexity comes back in a couple of seconds uh maybe three or four like like it's a good bit longer even than chat GPT it's an extr extremely detailed response they have figured out the colors of the football teams they have got I I kid you not 20 different rows of data on the stats of each of the football teams it was quite difficult to read the data it's not numeric data it's this funny little bar chart thing like points for points against by like number of of like pixels of bar across the screen and it is not going going to give you a direct answer I I could infer the answer because it talked about where the game was located at a particular stadium and it was correctly identifying it here in Seattle that does not mean that it was easy for me to read and understand it was just so much data on the page now I think that might be intentional just like they are going for more data with Finance aggressively perplexity may be going to be the nerd search engine where you want to go for more data if I was playing fantasy football I would look at points for and points against and a lot of other pieces of data to make decisions well I can find that on perplexity it's easier to find in one query than on Google but that's not what I was looking for it was a very simple query and it sort of felt like Overkill okay last but not least I went over to Google and did the same query Google was instantaneous I'm talking about less than the blink of an I I got an answer it was an answer I immediately understood and so I could look at it and I could say oh they're playing at Husky Stadium and they didn't use words to do it they used the way we phrase home and away games in American English and so if we say so and so at so and so like USC is playing at Washington we mean that they're playing in Seattle it's a and Google knows that and Google represents that visually so that you understand it you have the USC logo which everyone in college football knows then you have a little at word and then you have the Washington Huskies logo which is a Big W great I immediately understood I didn't have to be told I didn't have to read and so as much as the big players in AI are saying that they have Google on the ropes and they have Google right where they want them I look at that and I'm like not yet you don't have the speed yet and the representation of information isn't as clean as it needs to be so we will see but to my mind Google has a lot of legs left in it okay one more thing from Google they are also launching interesting experimental llm stuff all the time I've talked about notebook LM I want to talk about another conversational mashup that they are launching this one seems to match up search with Wikipedia so essentially what they're doing is they're launching a product called learn about and you can have a conversation about any subject you want to learn about and Google will write articles on the Fly for you about that it's like creating custom everchanging Wikipedia articles about any topic you want now the one catch is you cannot save this so in Notebook LS which Google also launched you can save what you're working on and come back to it later it's a notebook not with learn about you learn about it and apparently Google then forgets it so at least for now keep that in mind when you're using it that's what we got all about search have you tried search have you tried search with Chad GPT have you tried it with perplexity let me know what you think cheers
