# Riverside Take 04 Feb 3 2025 from Nate

okay guys we have to talk about deep research and we have to talk about that wild press conference with Sam Alman and masay Yoshi's son in Japan there is so much in there that's not getting reported widely so first deep research what is it it is not Google's deep research which seems to just scrape a bunch of websites pretty quickly and come back and give you a summary it was already very good it's not deep seek which is of course the big model that has shaken the markets it is a separate product that openai released currently on the pro plan although apparently it's going to go all the way down to free very shortly and it is the first one to use the full 03 model this is not 03 mini I feel like so much of my time on this channel is explaining their names this is the full 03 and that means that it is smarter than 03 mini which I suppose does make sense and what you do is you ask it a complicated question maybe you're asking it about legal cases maybe you're asking it about uh a scientific question or mathematics question or a history question something that would take you a few hours to dig into and understand you could ask about the evolution of Sanskrit for example and it will go and it will look very carefully for up to 30 minutes across everything it can find on the web and it will come back and it will write you a full paper with accurate citations now you might be thinking that that that's a whole lot like the identically named product that Google put out and the basic requirement functionality is but the results are much higher quality so yes just like deep research for Google it goes out and browses the web it comes back it writes a report it cites things but the results are much better I'm going to be putting up a substack later today that talks about sort of a side by-side comparison of what it looks like now that's deep research it just came out on the pro tier the press conference where deep research was released took place in Japan and there's a reason for that masay Yoshi son who is the chairman of soft bank which is a major funer for tech companies pulled Sam mman over to Japan because he's discussing a major funding deal for open AI separate from Stargate which he's also involved in and he had some interesting requirements from Sam which Sam agreed to that I think are really fascinating it shows that the people involved think that open AI is close enough to artificial general intelligence that it's time to make plans and so right from the stage MAA Yoshi son said we are going to announce artificial general intelligence right back here in Japan in less than two years and Sam agreed and so they've picked the place where they will announce AGI I also do not know what that will mean for open ai's relationship with Microsoft I guess that's for other people to figure out and then they also shared Sam and masay Yoshi son also shared that there will be a special company a sort of a fork of open AI if you will established in Japan that will focus specifically on a special uh model for Japanese company companies called Crystal and that model is supposed to independently review all of your source code and optimize it so it will be located inside a particular company's firewall it will review and update and maintain source code it will apparently listen to calls it sort of sounds like they're describing a deity right which is kind of weird uh but they're going to sort of sort of build this thing called Crystal and it will do all of these magical things inside the company and apparently that will also happen very quickly and that benefit will be exclusively according to Sam for Japanese companies initially and I think that is also Again part of the implicit deal I think what's going on here is that SoftBank wants a legacy opportunity here they want to show they brought AGI to Japan and they don't want it to be something where they just invested in a US company and the US company was the one that did you know this amazing Humanity changing achievement called artificial general intelligence by the way my hands coming in and out because I'm in a weird place and I have to have an artificial background um so it gets weirder like you might think a model named Crystal that lives in your company and listens to your phone calls and does your source code is weird and it is it it feels a little strange uh but it gets odder because then during the press conference uh I am not making this up masay Yoshi son told told Sam Alman that it was it was good that I I can't believe I'm going to say this that it was good that AI won't be eating people because AI doesn't need protein as a source of energy and and he said that right out loud at the press conference and I just I I don't even know what to make of that and I don't think Sam really knew what to make of that either it's just it's very strange so for lack of a better term I think the traditional term for this would be an eccentric billionaire has decided to fund AI his legacy will be that AI uh artificial general intelligence is announced in Japan that apparently is a done deal now apparently it's less than two years away and in the meanwhile we have this tool called Deep research that frankly does the work of a graduate intern on the research side of things now Sam made a big claim Sam said this does a single digit percentage of the economically valuable work in the world I can think of a few times when I have needed graduate level research work done but not a ton and I don't know if I would agrees a single digigit percentage that doesn't take away from the value of the tool it's a very valuable tool if you ask the right questions and you need the right questions answered most white color workers do not need this of research done for them on a regular basis they have other things that they have to do but research at this level is not one of them for people in science for people in Academia it is a different thing this is a big deal so take it for what you like deep research happened over the weekend and I didn't even tell you oh my God so hum's last exam which is I think going to turn out to be a terrible name for this thing is an exam That was supposed to be very hard for AI to crush and we all know how this goes because this happened so many times before uh 01 was at I think around uh 9% and then R1 came in and now that they've seen the Humanity's last exam they are sort of tuning to it and so R1 did a little bit better but not much like at like 10% or so 11 um and then 03 mini High came in and it was at 13% uh and that was on Friday by the way that was just Friday and then Sunday came along uh and I guess it was Monday morning Japan time and lo and behold lo and behold this thing uh deep research it gets to 25% on Humanity's last exam so in two days the new high was set from 133% by 03 mini High to 25% by full 03 using deep research mode there you go uh I don't know maybe it'll be 50% by Tuesday we'll see uh it's a wild time we live in cheers
