# We can't communicate how AI works to regular humans and it's a big problem

I'm going to take you back if you are like gray bearded like me you remember before Google when we were using the internet and we depended on hyperlinks and you remember that sense of Joy when you like find something and you couldn't have found it by search because search didn't exist and there was this little tip and then you went to the hyperlink and you found a page that's what AI is like right now that's what using AI is like and look I don't want another Google of AI although we might have one with open AI to be honest but we do need something that enables us to more effectively understand what we have with artificial intelligence and if you look at it as a problem of understanding if you look at it that way you have so many different dimensions of this problem that crystallize into a single core issue and that's what I want to talk about I would argue that effectively we don't know how to navigate latent space we don't understand what latent space in large language models is like we haven't visualized it well haven't understood it properly and everything stems from that as an example all of these annoying prompting tips and prompt this and prompt this way and like tell it you want it to be amazing at its job and tell it you're on vacation in France and tell it this and tell it that I kid you not every time I turn around there's another one of these things they're all about trying to nudge the llm through late and space but we don't really understand it another example that's the same core issue all of these building tips that basically are like this is how you tell cursor or Bol or lovable or wind surf or pick your tool of choice how to build something tell it like this give it a full Dev plan break it into chunks do this do that it's all about basically telling a large language model how to navigate Laten space to produce tokens of code and if you go farther a field if you're talking about how to make marketing posts about how to produce content for customer success emails about how to write sales emails or sales scripts again you run into the same issue where effectively companies are monetizing the inability to navigate late in space a lot of the solutions being shared or built or monetized or built through YC or whatever you have are basically ways to take these large unwieldy models and productize them into something that is a lot more stable and a lot more consistent and that's not bad I don't object to companies doing that being able to basically Bally take an intelligence and package it is a totally legitimate service but I do think it raises the fundamental question it highlights the fundamental question if you're watching properly because it underlines the fact that nobody really has a good grasp on latent space and we certainly do not have a good grasp on how to talk about latent space I saw a digital representation of a single Chain of Thought running through an l M and it looks like a Rat's Nest like it's like running all through this like visualized uh latent space and of course that's not how Laton space actually looks so it's like this colored string running through and I was like wow this looks complicated and that's how I walked away and at best that's where people are at like I'm the fluent one the people who don't even know what late and space are are scratching their head saying how did the llm come up with a sentence and we are so lost on communicating how this works that we don't have good answers to people who are at that level we certainly don't have good answers to how to use the technology for people we've given people a chat screen and said here's a chat but people are used to talking with other human beings they're not used to talking with a hyperdimensional intelligence that navigates through Laten space to answer their queries and a lot of the issues come from the fact that they treat the chatbot as if it was a person in some cases they treat it as if it was a person with the expectations of a computer and we've talked about that where you sort of expect the computer to be perfect and so you expect the AI to never make a mistake but by and large they treat it like a person make sure you answer me in this way or write this email to Bonnie in this style or hey I'm having a bad day today those companion apps definitely make money um and so I think that we can get farther if we are more honest about about how weird these things are llms are really weird it's weird that they work it's not necessarily intuitive and we kind of got farther on the Internet by just acknowledging it was a new thing like hey here's the Internet it's not like the newspaper you can click on links now and you can go new places and oh there's a search engine so you can search for anything it's not like a newspaper or a book imagine a card catalog but you can search the entire world those were the kinds of things we talked about we need that kind of language for large language models we need it to be like imagine a world where you have an intern that has read every book ever written but it's still kind of dumb or imagine a world where you have a very specialized Professor who knows everything there is to know about biochemistry but you'd never trust him out at dinner because he doesn't know a whole lot of or imagine a world where you need to get an answer to something and you're going to get six answers and none of them are right but all of them are interesting and they will help you get to the right answer we're not doing enough of that kind of communicating and we're not demystifying it when we portray it as a secret when we portray it as here's a tip from an expert it's not helping it makes people think it's hard and I don't think it does any of us a service who know AI well if we keep portraying it as something that is difficult to practice something that is difficult to try something that it is difficult to execute on at a high level because honestly it's not let me give you a specific example here we'll talk about building for AI which is one of those things that people to like if you're an engineer you sort of know how to build but then you have to learn how to build with AI and if you've never built or never coded you just sort of scratch your head and like stare at the wall and you don't know what to do let me try something on with you like we're actually going to try and solve this one as an example of how to solve this stuff better I have eight steps that I think you can walk through with anyone even someone who hasn't built an application before and say look this is kind of how you work with an AI on this number one figure out what you want to make you can use an AI to brainstorm and that's as hard as it needs to get right brainstorm come up with some solutions brainstorm some ideas for features um and then you kind of want to think about what you don't want to have in right and now in a product management sense that's scoping I don't need to use the word scoping for that I can just say what you don't want to have in now I will say as I go through these eight this doesn't mean that if I can explain this well everyone in the world is going to be come an AI Builder just like I can explain cooking but not everyone's going to become a chef but we can still communicate clearly so let's go to number two architecture you want to outline how the AI is going to work because as you can imagine the AI has to use information where does that information live does it live on the web page do you want to change it much does it live in the library behind the web page are you going to have payment you want to understand those pieces and you probably want to work with an AI to figure out what all those pieces are and then start to brainstorm what you need to build it might have some fancy words like API it might have a a word like a database in it which is really a fancy word for a data library but at the end of the day you're going to come out of a architecture and Technical planning conversation and you're going to say to yourself I understand where the data goes because that's really all it is and AI can help with that once you understand where the data goes you have to understand what the data looks like we would call that data schema how you actually structure the data AI can help a ton with that because if you know what the data is AI is pretty good with arranging it number four setting up your building world now if you're building something simple it comes preset up you can go to lovable you can go to bolt or you can go to cursor and wind Surf and you can just set it up yourself with some simple rules either way it's like clearing the table and getting set up to build a model you want to make sure that you're set up correctly you see how I'm using these analogies all the way through I'm not just doing this because I think you don't know how to build I'm doing this because I want to practice communicating well and show how important it is to communicate well with a real example that I run into all the time backend in database implementation is what you start with after you've decided to start to build and you could say that really simply by saying you know what if you're building you want to start with a foundation the foundation is the library of information you want to make sure the library of information is solid so you can pull information in and out of it if you build the front of the website first and just build the page you'll have a nice looking website with no library of information behind it you'll be in trouble after you build the library of information you're going to want to build the web page you look at that's the part you're probably really excited about but you see it's 6 we've had to be really patient to get here just like building a great model airplane you may want to put the wings on and make it look really pretty at the end but you have to wait and by the way if if this is all feeling child level I have in the back of my head my own kid who I have to explain this stuff to and so if I can explain it to her I can explain it to anybody okay number seven you're going to have to test to see if it works so make sure when you're building you include testing test if the data runs into the library of data test if it runs back that's really important finally you want to put it somewhere where other people can get it we call that deployment there are apps for that you can see where I'm going that's the eight steps to build now I ran through them really quickly I'm sure you can find better ways to communicate that it doesn't have to be at the level of a 9-year-old which is basically what I did but we do need to find simpler ways to explain how llms work and what they do for us and that's the heart of the point that I want you to take away it's really important to be clear about that so give me your best takes how can we get better at explaining these weird large language model intelligences so that it's easy to understand and other people can understand what we're trying to talk about and share and why it's so cool
