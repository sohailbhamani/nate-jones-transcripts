# 12 hacks for AI in Tech Job Searches: 5 things to avoid and 7 tips that make LLM's work for you

we need to talk about resumés and AI because there are a lot of people who are giving really conflicting perspective and I'm a hiring manager I've been hiring in this cycle and I have fairly strong opinions about where AI can effectively be used by applicants and where it should not be used so I want to break that down into two lists and I'm going to go into a fair bit of granular detail that's what a nice long form video like YouTube is about so first a good list of things that you should not be using a large language model for during your job application process are you ready number one do not use a large language model to write your whole resume for you don't do it the reason why is that large language models have a house style unless you are reasonably a Adept an expert at prompting large language models with a system prompt that substantially changes their house style so that it sounds very very very much like you and it's distinctive and it's individual then don't do it and if all of that didn't make sense to you then you're not using a system prompt that is going to help you and you should definitely not be doing it fundamentally unless you have a fair bit of work put in an llm is going to sound like an llm Claude has a house style Gemini has a house style open Ai and chat GPT have a house style do not let that house style into your resume because so many other people are doing so you end up sounding like all the other applicants is that what you want is that what you're looking to do is to not stand out from the crowd because that is typically what happens when you let an llm write your resume all right that's number one number two if there are questions from the company to you during the applicant process don't use an llm to answer them same reason if you use an llm you have a house style and for for a second reason those questions are typically designed to measure incisive and careful thinking and next token predictors which is what a large language model is are not going to give you the clarity of thought that you need to stand out it's going to feel like word salad maybe not inaccurate word salad but word salad anyway and if it feels even a little bit fudgy or a little bit flabby or a little bit sloppy then the person reading the response is going to think that's the way you communicate that you're not incisive that you're not concise that you're not clear and you don't want that again it's not helping you stand out okay third thing do not use an llm to tune your resume I know it's really tempting when you have a lot of applications to do to just say to the llm please tune the resume to match this job description but the problem is you lose all of your own style in that process and the house style comes back and the llm isn't necessarily inserting the keywords that you want it to insert on the correct bullets and if you are reading several hundred resumés you start to get an ear for when people are using keyword packing and llms tend to be not super subtle about hiding the keyword packing and that's actually one of the things you have to do to write a good resume yes you want to match the keywords but it needs to feel natural and in my experience an llm written resume has trouble adjusting and tuning and bringing those keywords in without making it reasonably obvious what's going on and it does stand out if you've read a bunch of resumés all right number four don't use an llm for the Final Phase of preparation for interviews and I'll come back to this theme but at the end of the day the reason why interview preparation is so important is because your brain needs to actually speak something out to sound natural so don't use it for interview prep or you're going to sound like you're reading from a large language model output you're going to sound really robotic and yes I know there are some people who literally get the llm answers printed onto a screen while someone is interviewing them and it is obvious and people do know and it's a huge red flag because we need you to think creatively and think incisively and think for yourself and so if you are practicing with an lolam you are unlikely at the final stage of practice to be able to articulate your answer in your style using your words and your voice in a way that feels natural so that Final Phase of interview practice has to be with another human has to be with a mirror if you don't have another human to practice with okay and then the last one that I would say that you don't do is do not use a large language model that has search capabilities such as chat GPT or even perplexity for company research that is high fidelity so if you're doing interviews and you get to like the second round or Beyond you need to have a really good idea of what the company does so that they can imagine working with you because you have so much corporate knowledge right already it is hard to get that level of uh tactile fine grained detail if you are using an llm as an interface and the reason for that is that they are designed to summarize and when they summarize they do lose detail and you need that detail to stand out from the crowd so don't use them for that really high fidelity research that you need to do to truly stand out in subsequent rounds of interviews okay that was a list of five different things you should not be using large language models for but there are things you should be using large language models for in the application process and that's the second list and that's what we're going to get to now so what you should use large language models for is one I think they're great tools for rfit analysis if you to think about does this role fit my skills does this role fit my job description is there a way I can quantify that or measure that yes there are pre-built tools like teal that do that you can also prompt and work with a large language model just in the chatbot experience and get a great result just by having them read the two documents a job description print out and then your resume and starting to have a conversation about the fit and the weaknesses and the gaps that's a super useful way to use a large language model to understand whether you fit a role another useful way to understand an llm this is number two get them to tell you what is distinct about that role that doesn't fit the other standard job descriptions again you're asking the llm to look through its enormous experience I guarantee you it has read more job descriptions in your job family than you have ask it to look at an individual JD and say what is distinct about this and then press it and make sure that it's really clear that's a great use for a large language model because that will help you to read and understand intent because the large language model can go beyond just saying this is a distinct sentence it can tell you this is a sentence and this is my supposition based on my extensive Corpus of text the whole internet of text on what the intent behind that bullet was and it may not be 100% right but it's right enough that it will give you a clue that you might not pick up on otherwise so I think it's a good use just to like understand what's distinct about resumés and help you analyze them rapidly or understand what's distinct about job descriptions because those are the ones you're looking at so number three it's really helpful to identify missing keywords and this is goes in the same category of like comparing r fit and so if if you're comparing r fit which is a different thing you have to understand at a high level if the if the rolles fit that's number one number two understand what's distinct about the role we just talked about that number three if you're going to apply do a second level of analysis between your resume and the job description and specifically look for missing keywords and this is different than keyword packing it's the first step it's the analysis step where it calls out the missing keywords llms do a great job at that it may be on you to work in the keywords but llms can help you pull them out and understand what you have to add in really fast okay number four llms are really good at helping you with blank page syndrome so you know how I said earlier in this uh in this YouTube that you should not use a large language model for writing a whole resume that's true you should also not use it for those questions I talked about that but if you need a draft it's a great drafter it gets you past staring at a blank page and that can accelerate you because there is nothing harder as a writer than just looking at the blank page and wondering where to start we just don't have that problem which is a 10,000 year old Problem by the way it's disappeared in 2024 we don't have blank page syndrome anymore or we don't have to anybody can get off of the blank page immediately and you should and you should use a large language model for that and then you should edit the heck out of it all right number five uh you should be looking at how you can break through fluency blocks in your overall application process with a large language model and I'm going to give you two examples oftentimes people don't understand networking and they and they talk about hey how do I Network how do I Network in my situation for my job role how do I get past the shyness large language models are not going to give you personalized Insight from someone who's done it before but if you're getting past the blank page syndrome for a skill like networking they are super helpful to give you a sense of what's in the box and especially if you prompt them and ask them to think about about it from a strategic perspective and a non-transactional perspective which is how you should be networking they're going to give you really thoughtful initial advice like a first passet advice if you're looking to understand the skill in general it can be helpful and almost everyone has gaps in their skill set over the course of a job application process there are areas where you are strong maybe you're really strong at resumé editing in areas where you're weak maybe that's networking maybe that's looking at other job sites besides LinkedIn and so what you're weak at is actually getting the full top of funnel for job Discovery llms are that's another thing they're good at like you can talk to them and say I don't know where else to go for jobs besides Linkin can you help me find some that is a good use for something like perplexity basically you want to tune the llm to give you a sense of how you break through that skill Gap it's not going to give you a high fidelity excellent super professional final answer on these things but it will get you through that initial really um painful feeling skill learning phase faster and that's what you want it's accelerating you and that's what you should be looking for okay and I also know at the top of this YouTube video I talked about how you should not use large language models for the Final Phase of interview practice and that is true you should not be doing that but you should be using large language models if you were feeling stuck and need to practice your initial interview structure and so if you're doing the first half of interview prep where you're determining do I have the anecdotes do the anecdotes match the anticipated questions do the anecdotes have the right structure to them so that someone who is a typical interviewer can understand what I mean am I using the star technique am I using the parade technique am I opening myself up to followup questions that are risky llms are great as conversational tools to help you get through that initial phase of interview practice so absolutely use them for that first half and then when you actually need to feel natural and practice it verbally that's when they're not helpful anymore all right I'm going to give you one final tip I believe this is tip number seven for how to use large language models in application prep and sort of the whole job search process you know how I said earlier in the video that you should not be using a large language model such as perplexity or such as chat GPT with for researching at a high level of fidelity your company that you're targeting great don't do it but you can use a large language model to get a highlevel view of the industry and the competitors for the company because again that plays to the system's strengths it allows it to look across the whole industry I guarantee you it's read more articles than you have and to synthesize it up and if you're looking to synthesize and summarize a lot of detailed information that you found that maybe not publicly available on the internet maybe you maybe you've dug in the sec's website and you found 10K filings for these companies and they're recent so they're outside the training data set for the llm throw them in it's going to be able to summarize them very very rapidly and at a good enough degree of fidelity that you can understand what the competitor strategy is pretty quickly and that is going to give you a working knowledge of the industry and competitors that makes you stand out because typically you don't see someone dinged in Loop Fe back sessions for not having a high enough Fidelity view of competitors what they're dinged for in that area is not knowing competitors at all or not knowing the industry at all and large language models can get you past that so there you go that is a series of five ways not to not to use large language models and seven ways to use large language models as you're going through your application and your job search process AI is a powerful tool for helping you just need to use it in a way that supports your overall journey and your ability to stand out and that's what I wanted to call out here let me know what I missed in the comments
