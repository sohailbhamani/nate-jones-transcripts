# This was the biggest week in tech ever - Tesla, SpaceX, xAI

we had one of the wildest weeks in Tech we've ever had it had nothing to do with open AI or Google or Amazon it had everything to do with a family of companies owned by Elon Musk I am not an Elon Fanboy on this site I barely talk about him but I have to acknowledge what happened in the last week let me go through because I don't know that everyone has realized that all of these happened in the space of a week so Elon introduces a apparently independent robot that interacts with the crowd yes there's probably some tea operation but you can see the writing on the wall Elon introduces a self-driving car Elon introduces a self-driving van all at an event at the Warner lot in La that alone would be a massive weeken Tech that's for his company Tesla then just on Sunday the mech Zilla which is literally right out of a science fiction film Elon tweeted about the fact that he wanted to have big science fiction arms catch his giant rocket then he built it and then it worked because the maxella caught the super heavy booster on the first try and the videos all around the world you can see it everywhere and everyone is rightly flabbergasted it's it's like taking a skyscraper into the sky and then gently placing it back down exactly where you want it to be so he did that too on on top of the robot on top of the taxi on top of the van and then that wasn't enough he also turned on the world's biggest supercomputing cluster in a world record of 19 days and that got done this week too so 100,000 h100s from Nvidia and it all got done it got turned on it got ready to train for an AI run in just 19 days now there are some benefits he got from having multiple companies here because apparently to get the h100s at the last minute he was still short um a few thousand and he redirected several thousand units that were headed to Tesla over to X which is the company formerly known as Twitter and now apparently owns the biggest AI supercomputing cluster in the world not open AI it's wild uh so he redirected it over there um and that's how he got to 100,000 but regardless his incredible achievement and here's my reflection if this person is willing to take these kinds of Serial risks risk after risk after risk with these companies he's pivoting a car company into a robotics company he is doing something that everyone says is physically impossible with his rocket company and he's taking a social media company and turning it into an AI company these are non-trivial risks they might not work I'm not here to to say just cuz he had a good week they're all going to work but if he is risk on right now if he is willing to take risks it suggests to me that the prevailing attitude I see among most of my colleagues that I work with in Tech maybe to risk averse this may not be a time to be riskof and so I don't have the resources to go put up a supercomputing cluster in 19 days I'm not building the next mazilla but I am thinking about where am I to risk averse where might I benefit from being a little bit more risk on so that's your thought for the day thanks Elon quite a Week in Tech
