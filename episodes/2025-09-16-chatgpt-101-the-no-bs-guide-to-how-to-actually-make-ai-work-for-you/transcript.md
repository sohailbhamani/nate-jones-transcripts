# ChatGPT 101: The No BS Guide to How to Actually Make AI Work for You

This is the no BS guide to actually using AI. I get so many questions that are actually really reasonable and it tells me that AI is doing a disservice to all of you. Like the AI can't teach it. Google can't teach it. Most of the people out there are spouting generic nonsense and you're left asking me really specific questions like Nate, how do I compare two financial reports? How do I know which one is right? or Nate, AI is giving me an answer and I don't know if I should believe it or not. Or Nate, the rewritten email doesn't sound right. How do I make it sound better? Over and over again, people are asking these questions. They're right to ask them. AI is supposed to be able to help with this stuff, but we in the teaching community are doing you all a disservice because we haven't communicated it clearly enough with enough good examples. That's what I'm here to do today. That is what this time is for. We are going to get on screen. We're going to look at some specific examples. We're going to explain why they work. And there's going to be lots more examples in the write up. I want you to walk away feeling like this is the most concrete, specific AI class that you have ever been to. Like you got to spend a lot of time with Nate hanging out talking about prompts and getting your real questions answered. So, with that in mind, let's get to it. All right. Our first example is a real example I got questions about. Help me tell my manager to stop changing my deadlines. Well, this is the first version. This is what a lot of people start with, just one sentence. And to be honest, the answer isn't too bad, right? Uh the AI comes back. It thinks for 17 seconds and it gives you an email that you can send. It gives you a live script you can deliver. It feels a little bit cold. Like who wants to tell their manager, I want to deliver predictably. When deadlines change after we commit, we incur rework and slip risk. That sounds like Chad GPT5 talking, not a person. Uh, and then you have an escalation ready and it just keeps going and going and going and what is your next step and it tries to give you hope. I will say it gives you a lot for that one line, but my question is how usable is it? How usable is it for that one line? For example, does it actually work for you to freeze dates 48 hours before kickoff or did it just make that up? You get the idea. The more context you give the AI, the more it's going to be useful for you. Why don't we see an example that is exactly the same question, but with just a little bit more meat on the bone for the prompt. And let's see how Chat GPT5 handles this. Okay, the first thing that we see is that this is a longer prompt. Let's break it down and see what we did. Is it scary? Not too scary. Uh, it's got some labels, but my manager changes project deadlines every week. Usually mentions it in passing. That's already useful. This is what I need you to do. Set up a simple process for deadline changes without seeming difficult or rigid already. This is differing from the answer chat GPT5 gave previously. These are my these are my boundaries. I can't send sound accusatory. I can't damage the relationship. This is what success feels like to me. And then this is the audience, my manager. This is the tone, etc. So, this is very specific, right? Uh here's what you get. You get a very specific set of options. You either get the lightweight tracking option. I really value how quickly you move things forward. Your speed helps us respond to shifting priorities is very much the sandwich approach to conflict, right? But when deadlines shift in conversations, I can miss the update and realize later. What do you think about us logging deadline changes in a single shared tracker? This is a talk track I could see actually using. This is immediately more useful. If you want to go farther, you actually have the option to write down a little nudge and use that as part of the method. And so this is where Chad GPT is actually suggesting what if whenever you shift a date, I jot it down and send a oneliner back. This is both a script and also a suggestion for a change in process in one go here. And then there's also the weekly snapshot. What if we do a weekly snapshot where we look at the deadlines and make sure it's right and then it comes back with if they push back, how you handle it, assumptions about their motivation. So it logs it and then you can refine it from there. What do you see here? What I see if you compare it to the initial version is that this is actually usable for a realworld situation. And people who are getting started with AI will say, well, how did you get it to do that? What is the magic in this prompt? Well, to be honest, a lot of the magic in the prompt is giving the AI enough about you to be helpful. So, this detail changes project deadlines weekly. You see that coming back up in the options. This detail set up a simple process. You see each of the options has a simple process. If you look through this prompt, you can see that chat GPT has taken each of the words you've given it really seriously and tried to come up with something that puts it all together. And so what you're giving the AI in a prompt is not a set of magic words. It's actually enough context, enough um information about what you're doing that the AI can be helpful. So my manager values flexibility and speed. You'll notice these talk tracks mention that back because that's considered good practice. This is not magic. This is the AI coming back and trying to mirror what you give it. If you give it more, it will give you back more. Let's check out another real life example with a real life question mark. I love this one because it looks like a long prompt, but it's actually a very realistic short prompt. This is the prompt up here. Summarize my meeting notes. That's it. And then this just pastes in a bunch of meeting notes. In this case, to protect people's privacy, I actually had another AI make up the meeting notes. So, anyway, here are the meeting notes. There's a complete transcript. Uh, and then it comes back with meeting notes, right? And again, I don't want to underell it. There's some value here. It captures the outcomes in the notes. It captures the feedback. It captures some action items. This is not too bad, but it's really, really easy to do a little bit better than that and make these notes much more useful. In particular, if you have ever been in meetings, you know that one of the really scary things about meetings is the idea that when we talk back and forth, sometimes we slide over project risk that needs to be written down, formalized, and talked about or else it just kind of slides under the radar and we end up discovering it on launch day. If you've been a project manager, a product manager, an engineer, uh, in marketing, you know that feeling. It's that clenching in your gut. How do you avoid that? These meeting notes don't help with that, but that's one of the most important things that you could actually get. These risks are fairly generic. GA delay strains marketing timelines. Okay, that's fine. Like, that's really generic. Let's see how a better prompt with the same transcript could change things. Okay, the first thing we notice is there doesn't seem to be a prompt here, but don't worry, there is. This is the meeting transcript. If we click show full message here and we scroll down, we eventually get to the prompt right here at the bottom. pull out and organize. I want a summary of the main things that happened. I want key decisions. I want open questions. I don't think that that one was very clearly pulled out before. I want risks. I want the next seven days. And I and you define the risks. You see how you define the risk with likelihood impact and who's on it. And please skip a section with nothing in it. Please don't add fluff. That's critical. And you'll notice how obsessed chat GPT is with following this. It immediately comes back with summary of five main things that happened. It is trying to tell you with this word that it has paid attention to don't add fluff or context and it's taking it really seriously. It identifies the onboarding bottleneck, the performance fix, the GA launch, the pricing tiers. It it gives you all of this stuff. Okay, so these are your top five. It gives you decisions that happened. It gives you open questions and it gives you risks that are much much more interesting. And this by itself is worth the price of admission for the prompt because you can then look at that meeting and you can say, "Oh, you're right. Marcus and David are supposed to be watching the performance fixes, but I'm not clear that they actually have it after I kind of think through the meeting. Maybe I should follow up with them." This pulls out those things that are intangible in the meeting and makes them tangible. In other words, chat GPT is actually adding value here. And it's not adding value because it's magic. It's adding value because it is following the instructions that you gave it. If we come back here, all we had to do to get that kind of magical response was to say, "Please tell me what could go wrong very specifically, and then say this is what I care about. I care about the risk, how likely it is to happen, the impact, and who's watching it." These are not magic words. If you wrote uh the risk, the probability that it's going to occur, uh what will happen if it occurs, and the owner, it would still mostly just work the same way. The point is, can you explain in really clear words what you want? Can you explain what matters to you? And I think we're hanging out here, right? This is the chat GPT classroom. One of the things that people really miss with AI that they struggle with with AI is this idea that you can ask for something that you want that you haven't seen before done well and it can still work. When I was keeping notes manually and yes I did that for a long long time. I did not often see risks as clearly laid out as I just showed you. That was rare. But now, even if I don't have a good example beyond saying this is what I want, I can still get it done. And so, one of the things that I like to tell people in Chad GPT class is have the courage to imagine a better way to do things and then find the words to express it. That is one of the biggest keys to prompting. And I find that people have these light bulb moments when that happens. are like, "Oh, I can just ask for it." Yeah, you can ask for it. You can ask for it. Let's look at another example, but we're going to make it more fun. I love this example because it's a what do I do when I don't have a prompt example. I have a situation not covered in Nate's guide. Right? Here's the situation. I need to compare two financial reports. I need to understand the drivers for financial performance between them. I need you to give me an answer in 100 words or less. And the audience is financial professional. Now, you might think that's the prompt. That is the context. And I'm going to explain how you explain that to the AI. It's very clear. Here's my context. It's four different bullets right now. This is what the you're actually asking the AI to do using the guides methods. Uh and then you define them here. Ask do clear format delta only revisions, which means revisions that are only about the difference between situations and verification. Please make a brief outline of two approaches to handle this situation. A full prompt to paste into AI, including the context, the instructions, the format, and the verification step. And then please explain why this works. That is what you're asking AI to do. This is an example of asking chat GPT to write the prompt for you. Your real instruction here is write the prompt for me. And if you were in the business of teaching AI, you have to be able to explain this because one of the things that we learned from that survey of 700 million uh chat GPT users that came out this week is that we have such a wide range of use cases for AI that we need that personalized perspective. You need to be able to teach people to prompt like this so that they don't have to carry around a gigantic sheet of all of these different prompts. like they need something that works for more than one thing. So then chat GPT comes back and it comes back with two options. You have what it calls a driver delta. It can highlight changes in revenue, cost, margins or cash flows between reports A and B or it can come back with uh attributing performance shift to particular volume, price mix or cost controls and quantify the impact. You can choose. And so for example, so here's the full prompt. It's assuming key drivers. It's assuming number one here. Uh we can say actually please write the factor attribution approach prompt instead and it will come back with the other prompt. And there you go. It's a full prompt. It's ready for you to attach those files and get going. Not by the way because there's a magic word up here. The only thing you did up here was you took what would be a generic prompt and you made it into something financial with the words that you used. This is what is telling Chad GPT it's a financial prompt. You can put anything in there. You can change it entirely. As an example of changing entirely, let's just do this real quick. We'll do it live. Okay, here we are. We're going to delete all of the financial report stuff. You're going to watch this run live. Going to delete all of these things. This is the only thing we have to delete, right? We deleted all of this stuff. That's super easy. We're going to change the situation. I need to talk to my kids teacher about her homework. My goal have a constructive conversation and get strategies to help with reading chapter books. Constraints don't want to break the relationship with the teacher. I'm deliberately leaving that typo in. Actually, I want you to remember you can leave typos in audience. Uh the teacher. Um and so I need a prompt for this, right? I don't know how to even approach this. Um please help me figure it out. So I hit go. So it gives me different options. You can say frame is wanting to work together. Share a neutral observation. Um and then it gives me a frankly nice prompt. I need to talk to my child's teacher. Please generate two conversational scripts using a collaborative ask and an observation ask. revise into one recommended version. I love this. I never came up with this. Chad JPT did this. And then it explains to me why it works. Um, please run the prompt. And then, and you notice it worked with a typo. And then, please explain to me like I'm 12 why it works. Okay. This is giving me words I wouldn't have been able to find. I really appreciate how much effort you've put into helping my child build her reading skills, especially if it's an emotional thing. As a parent, these kinds of scripts are helpful. gives me a recommendation. Uh, it gives me a sense of why it thinks it works and it gives me a sense of the why. Right? If you if you say you're the expert, what should I practice? The coach feels respected. It gives me a metaphor with soccer that works. Uh, I'm going to go one step further here to close out our example. Uh, can you explain uh like I'm 12, again, I'm leaving the typo, why this prompting approach works well. Um, how does prompting like this help you as the AI help me better? I love this. Think of me as a fast, eager helper. I sometimes get carried away. If you say, "Help me talk to my kids teacher," I might give you something polite but random because I don't know what's most important. But when you use structured prompting, you're telling me what question you want me to answer, what action you want me to take. You're giving me constraints, and that ultimately helps me help you. Fantastic. Yes, chat. GPT can help you prompt. Let's look at one more example. This one is almost never covered in classes, and I think that's disappointing. Most of the time, people will give you a single prompt like I've been showing you, and then they'll be like, "Go and be well. You have your prompt." You know, you have Nate's master prompt. You're off you go. Well, what if you aren't that person? What if you're having a conversation? How do you have a conversation that progressively reveals the information you need? So, for example, again, a real question. You get to a more human sounding email. And so, here's an initial situation. Already, this is fine, right? I run a design agency. A client's been with us for 3 years. They want to rush the project. I need to turn them down nicely without ruining the relationship. Please keep it short. Uh, please don't use bud buzzwords. Uh, and if they can understand that that we can't help now, but they'll reach out later, that's great. It comes back. This is okay. It's kind of it still feels wordy. I feel like I would not send this because it feels like a wall of text to a client. Uh, and so I want to give the I want to give the the AI a little bit more context to help me. Okay, so this is a CMO. I worked with them for years. You need you need to know that, right? I need friendly but professional tone like I'm talking to a colleague. Um, and someone else they could work with is something that I want to include here because you just realize that right as you're reading the draft. So comes back. Uh, it's a little better. I'm grateful you reached out. We've really valued working together. There is a recommendation in here. Uh, it still feels a bit like a wall of text. Um, and so I just want some advice. And so I I just ask that, right? Actually, you know what? Before writing anything, please give me two different ways I could handle the decline. Ask me a question about the situation that might help you to write better. And this is a great example in a multi-turn conversation where you can actually throw the ball back to chat GPT and you can ask it to ask you, right? you can ask it to give you tips and that will be really helpful. So it comes back, it says you can protect the relationship with a really clear referral or you can position it very much as a timing issue and emphasize future work more. And so it's taking from what you've told it and saying which do you want me to emphasize and then it's asking do you want the referral to be the heart of the message or something that's lighter that you might try in the meantime and that's a really nuanced question that we haven't given a perspective on. And so I looked at that and I'm like, I think I want a clear referral. You could have picked either one, but I went with option one. All I say is go with one. It drafts it out. This is already better. It's two paragraphs. It's more scannable rather than risk a rushed outcome. It's still a little cold. Uh and I feel like I'm worried that the buzzwords are still in there. So I'm saying skip the buzzwords. I need to have the subject line really clear and I need to have the email itself. And I that's that's all I want us to sort of focus on. I don't want it to be I don't want it to be anything but what I need to check and read. And I feel like right now when I look at it, it's better, but there's still something missing. And so I'm basically trying to get the AI to give me some clarity, especially around the subject line. So now we have this a quick note on the Rush project. Uh on timing for this project as a backup. Uh this is already better. It dumps the buzz. Dumping the buzzwords was really good, right? I'm glad you thought of us. We've loved working with you. That feels really natural. the M dash might be a little bit of a giveaway depending on who you believe about chat GPT writing but still it's it's not bad uh and then I ask it this look at what you wrote and I want you to tell me is it specific enough are we naming dates and steps now I haven't given it dates and steps but I want placeholders does it sound warm enough please list five things you changed to improve it you see how I'm basically leading the AI through an edit conversation I'm not just leaving it alone I'm not saying this is good enough people might have taken these and said, "Ah, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know." Uh, and you might be saying to yourself, "This is a lot of edits for an email." But think about it. This is a client that may be a six-f figureure client for this for this small firm. They don't want to lose them. They just need to delay things a bit. It absolutely is worth a 5minute conversation with Chad GPT to get to a better email. Okay. Is it specific enough? Chad GPT admits not quite. Does it sound warm enough? It's clipped. I agree. Here's some things I could do to include it or in not include it, improve it. Here's a revised version. We valued your trust for this rush request. I need to be honest. We can't give it the focus it deserves. I recommend this is very readable. It looks like it's almost there. Uh for this final version, tell me what assumptions are you making? How confident are you that this keeps the relationship strong? And what's one thing I should double check? You can actually ask them to double check it. Make sure the referral you name is reliable as the double check recommendation. I agree that sounds like an important. So there you go. What we have here is something that is now ready to paste in that is quite strong. It may not be perfect but it is strong enough that it is 90 95% there for a delicate email to a highv value six or seven figure client. We did not start there. You do not have to start with perfect with AI to get it where you want to go. And I want to go back through and note we're sort of following stream of thought and all we're doing is taking enough time to add the words so the AI knows how to key off of us so that it can be as helpful as possible. List exactly five small things you change to improve it is just a little bit more precise than tell me what you'd fix. Those are the kinds of small differences that aren't magic. They just help the AI help us. I hope that this has been a uh helpful multi-turn conversation to look through. I know we don't do a ton of these and I think it's really important to look at them because they show how we can follow our own train of thought and still get somewhere really useful with an AI. So, I want to close by going back to some of the things that people have been asking me initially and reframing them as larger questions that I see all over the internet that I see in my inbox and how we're answering them. So, how do I get better responses out of AI? That's one of the underlying questions. All I'm saying is give the AI enough context to help you. When I gave you those answers, I on purpose used the same kinds of labels in every single one. The situation, what I need, my constraints, what success looks like. You can name those different things. But those are some basic categories of meaning, categories of words that if you give that to AI, it can go farther for you. What prompts actually work? That's another one that I get a lot. These prompts work. I gave you real scenarios. They actually work. And they don't work because I wrote them. They don't work because they're magic. They work. And I hope you can see this because they give the AI the information it needs. I also hear a lot, I need examples for my specific job. Whether that's boss conversations, emails, meeting notes, whatever. I gave you some of those specific examples, but inevitably you're going to think of some that I didn't cover because this is only going to be so long. That is what those larger catchall prompts are for. And that's why I deliberately illustrated one of my examples, the financial analysis one with a catch-all prompt. You are empowered to go take that kind of a prompt and put it to use for your situation. And that is why I spent so much time showing you the actual prompts. It's not because I wanted to bore you. It's because I wanted you to understand how they work and I wanted you to see them really play out side by side so you could see I'm not just trying to make stuff up. I'm not just trying to tell you more words are better. I'm trying to give you clarity. I'm trying to give you the ability to get help from the AI. So if you take anything away from this class on AI, please take away a sense that it is not that hard to get to can use AI in many of my tasks every day. The prompts that I have just laid out for you covers so many different real work situations. All you have to do is slightly change the situation and what you need from the AI and your goal in situation and the context you give it and you're going to be off to the races. You can use an AI to get a better answer. You can shape what you get from chat GPT so it is more useful and we've seen so many examples of how to do that. Over to you. Best of luck and enjoy chat GPT. It is really an amazing tool and I hope that this has helped you use it better.
