# Tracker.Vote -- Election Tracker AI Build Example using Claude, Vercel, React

If you'd like to see something that I helped put up just yesterday, you can visit tracker.vote. So I used LLM tooling. I worked with a friend of mine. We went from idea to production deploy on a custom domain in just a hair over two hours. And it's a tiny little React app, and the entire purpose is to provide you a simple, very fast ad-free way to track votes in 50 states and to track the calls that are made for each state over the course of the November 5th election night, and I suppose into Wednesday as well. So if that's useful, that's great. I wanted to have fun and build something that was useful and also a nice exercise in showing how quickly you can get to production with an idea. So that's what I did. I'll link it. I think I'll also link the GitHub and you can look at it. So enjoy.
