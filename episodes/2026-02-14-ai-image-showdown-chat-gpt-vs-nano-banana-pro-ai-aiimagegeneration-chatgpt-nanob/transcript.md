# AI Image Showdown: Chat GPT vs. Nano Banana Pro! #ai #aiimagegeneration  #chatgpt  #nanobananapro

Let's see a comparison side by side. Okay, here we have a dual test. I wanted the model to take a celebrity and be able to repurpose the celebrity into a different location. I use Kira Nightly because her image is going to be widely available in training data and I wanted to see if the model could adequately present her in obviously an unusual situation. All I did was give it a blurry picture of Kier Knly and Pirates of the Caribbean and I said, "Please have her teach how LLM's work to both models." And so what you get on the right is not really a correct image of Kiara Nightly. You get a overall nice colorful very high level view of how LM work and as Chad GP2 5.2's approach. It's clear Nano Banana Pro knows Kiara Nightly. That's a photographically correct image of her. decided to put her in that costume and clearly knew the movie I was referencing. And then it has a much more detailed diagram of how LM's work, although it's not as visually appealing. Let's go to the child's alphabet. On the left, you see Nano Banana Pro, right? Chad GPT. Both models failed, but they failed in ways that are interesting. Chad GPT kind of fell apart here, like some form of W at the end and then an X way down there. We just didn't get where we needed to go here. Uh, and this is after multiple edits. So, I would say Nano Banana Pro did a better job, although neither model did
