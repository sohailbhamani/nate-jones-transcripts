# OpenAI: Mira is out, nuclear is in

AI news from the last couple days that you might have missed probably the first one is when you didn't miss Mira morati is leaving she has been the CTO for open AI she was involved in bringing Sam Alman back after the brewhaha and drama in 2023 when Sam was briefly forced out by the board well now that 01 is out now that voice mode is out she says it's time to leave and she's not the only one Barett zof the VP of research and Bob McGrew the chief research officer announced their departures on the same day and here is what I notice the people who were heading up ai's core research division during the time it has been primarily a nonprofit are walking out the door and that is happening at the same time that news is breaking that the board is considering making open AI for profit now anyone who's been reading the te Le since 2023 can see that the direction of open AI toward being a for-profit classic startup has been written on the wall it's been very obvious Microsoft would not build a partnership with Sam mman and open AI if they did not think they could get return on investment this is a for-profit company that may have had some unusual founding documents but fundamentally we're going to see a very classic VC model it'll be late stage it will burn a tremendous amount of cash which brings me to the last thing Mira leaving now is a real blow to Sam raising funds now he's by all accounts extraordinary at fundraising so that I wouldn't count him out but he is trying to raise the largest VC deal in history to continue to finance and sustain open Ai and it hasn't closed yet there's been rumors about it circulating for weeks having mea out doesn't help so we'll see how that goes but that's something I'm keeping an eye on in more news from Sam apparently he has been pitching the US government on helping build out a massive footprint of data centers across the US so these are 5 megawatt data centers like half a dozen of them five to seven of them scattered across the states I think Sam is probably pitching it as a jobs thing and just for context when you add this all up this is like 25 to 30 million homes worth of power like it's a lot of power and Sam's play is basically what wouldn't we want to build Ai and train our super intelligence model in the US so maybe I can get some help for that and we we'll see when it gets this big it's not unusual for companies to pitch the White House on something everything goes up in the air during an election year a pitch is just a pitch but it's worth thinking about because again it's another chess move in the ongoing play for fundraising it allows Sam to position open AI as having government Partnerships as well as VC Partnerships which in turn lowers a little bit of the risk for VC's looking at funding this is all reading the tea leaves it's speculation but it's not unusual to see that kind of play when you're trying to make something really big you want to lower the risk for everybody by showing you have other parties involved okay you might be wondering where all this power is coming from and that's where the energy side of things comes in so Microsoft recently Inked a deal to reopen Three Mile Island they decided probably cleverly to rename Three Mile Island because the pr for that is not great into the crane clean energy center and Pennsylvania put out a thing where it's like this is going to create lots of jobs and this is really great and uh it's like 3,500 jobs it will produce sort of uh stuff for the community and like you can get uh Power for lots of homes and in addition Microsoft will buy Power which by the way there's conflicting stories about that because Pennsylvania says this is going to help power homes and the press releases I've seen elsewhere say Microsoft is just buying all the power for AI so I don't know we will have to see it doesn't open till 2028 I think the idea though is that Microsoft is going to put an absolutely massive data center there and it's going to make a run at Super intelligence that's that's the play that I see on the table I think that's the play that such a Adel is making what's interesting is that this may not be open AI play at the end of the day Microsoft is a partner of open AI but that doesn't mean that everything they do in AI is about open AI they may be doing this for for you know something else they may be building their own model that they want to to play maybe maybe it's the Microsoft co-pilot they're trying to build on I I wonder how much open ai's partnership with Microsoft is going to last as the price gets closer and closer and closer people's interest start to diverge if Microsoft can fully own Super intelligence why would they why would they not why would they partner with open Ai and so just from a game theory perspective there's some interesting questions around to what extent we should view Microsoft's moves here as being supportive of open AI versus competitive it's an interesting question and that's the news for you today oh one more uh 14 Banks signed on to say they want to fund nuclear energy which when Banks make a public declaration I kind of roll my eyes we'll see how it goes but the fact that Three Mile Island found the funding to restart at the same week that 14 Banks signed on saying they want to do more nuclear energy is at least eye opening so we will see I think that part of the push here is that people are recognizing that the power draw requirements and the steadiness of power that's required for running true AI data centers it's so great only nuclear is going to be able to handle it and that's part of the pressure and I think banks are hungry for the share in the AI profitability and are willing to take the risk on nuclear and honestly as people who study nuclear will tell you it's relatively low risk it's just had a couple of of bad moments that have generated a very long Shadow from a reputational perspective even Three Mile Island did not actually cost anyone their lives no injuries and it's the worst disaster for nuclear power in US history so if there's no injuries and that was the worst disaster I can see why people are going back there you go it's all the news that I could uh dig up on I and energy and some of the politics around open AI tell me what I missed tell me where you think open AI is going this is like Game of Thrones for uh Tech nerds I'm curious to hear what you think
