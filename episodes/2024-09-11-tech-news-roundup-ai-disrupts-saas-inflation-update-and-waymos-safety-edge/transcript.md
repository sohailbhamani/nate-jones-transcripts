# Tech News Roundup: AI Disrupts SAAS, Inflation Update, and Waymo's Safety Edge

three big pieces of news today all around Tech we're going to talk about software and AI we're going to talk about the inflation news and we're going to talk about cars so software first if you've been following the story with AI the thing to remember is that there is a huge question right now around the extent to which a company will replace a software stack they pay for using a software as a service business model with something they build in-house well clar has started to do that they put out a press release a few months ago saying that they were saving 700 CS jobs because they had in-house AI deflection for CS queries now they're saying they've replaced Salesforce that's a big deal because Salesforce is more or less the biggest the most essential the first software as a service like if you think of software as a service Mark Benny off invented that business model more or less so they're getting replaced at clarum and it makes you wonder can other companies see that press release and start following suit I bet you right now there are a bunch of CEOs calling up their CTO this morning and saying do that this is an expensive contract so we will see but it's definitely a warning sign to companies like Salesforce that they need to continue to show value in the age of AI That's disproportionate or they will get built out and replaced it's not all bad news for software though because you see a couple of really interesting signals in the market that the push toward AI internally does not mean that companies won't grab external Solutions if that's what's appropriate and I want to call out a consumer facing or small business facing one as well as a big business facing one that's more like Salesforce so for the big business first glean got their second multi hundred million fund raise this year so they started out in February with a $200 million raise at 2.2 billion and now uh they're raising 200 60 million at a 4.6 billion valuation so they went from I I guess it was a $2.4 billion dollar valuation increase in just a few months here they're absolutely blowing up and what's interesting is they position themselves as AI native they are being treated as AI native by the market they're solving a knowledge problem that has been sticking with companies for decades Generations where you can't find what it was and like that's what slack sort of promised to do but slack isn't innovating fast enough in the AI space to really solve this and gleen is basically positioning itself as you can actually find what you need to find across email Wiki slack everything and get an AI powered summary well they're doing very well and the funny thing is they were founded back in 2007 and so even though they're positioned as AI native now it has been a long runway for them this this uh 260 million is a Series E so they have been patient and they have built for a long time to get to where they are and now they're just blowing up they're going to be the zoom of 2024 right if you remember Zoom back in 2020 just absolutely went through the roof the other one I want to call attention to is much earlier in the process this is a YC company called proost Ai and the reason I call it out is not because it has as much of a true proven track record as glean does at this point but because it highlights that you can get software that is AI native that goes after smaller businesses as well and so in this case proost AI is basically automating the Airbnb host experience where you can like automate a lot of communication with your guests you can automate a lot of the servicing communication Etc there's a Airbnb is now big enough that you can have an entire startup that is just focused on figuring out the logistics of the hospitality industry that professional hoteliers have been sorting out for a long time with staff and I think that's really interesting and it gives them room to get into the rest of hospitality if they can make this scale so it's not all bad news for software but let's move on let's go to the inflation print so online grocery sales fell 3.7% in the month of August it's the biggest decrease on records since records start being kept for online groceries in 2014 and I call it out because the Fed was already looking at an interest rate cut this is going to be another data point that fuels the speculation that the FED is headed for an interest rate cut and that matters because the IPO rate since the interest rate rise in 2022 has gone through the floor in 2021 we had 140 exits by IPO from the mostly from the tech industry in 2022 to 2024 year-to date inclusive we have had 14 14 10% in three years of what we had just in 2021 now 2021 was a big year but it calls out how tough it's been for startups to exit and if you can't exit the entire Venture Capital model kind of goes into deep freeze and that is what we have seen as far as capital allocation which trickles into jobs and everything else and so a lot of what I've been watching is when will the FED start to loosen the capital so VCS start to get hungry again it doesn't mean it's going to go back to 2020 and 2021 right away but it does mean that there may be a restart of that funding model maybe the IPOs start to come back Etc so I'm keeping an eye on that last but not least someone uh dove into wh's crash driving data and called out it was a really interesting analysis they called out that a lot of the crashes reported by weo are crashes where their self-driving vehicle was rammed by another human by by a human driver wayo self-driving so it's not another human driver right uh the machine car was s rammed by a human driver and that when you take that into account weo is even safer than you might realize in fact the estimate is that weo is UH 60 to 70% safer than human drivers at this point net net so there's a lot of lives to be saved by rolling out way more more broadly and what's interesting is the reason it's 60 to 70% is because we have a really hard time actually estimating the Baseline human crash rate there's a lot of really interesting like discussion of that I'll link the article underneath the YouTube but there you go that's your news lot on software a little bit on uh inflation and IPOs in the exit market and a little bit on cars just at the end what did I miss
