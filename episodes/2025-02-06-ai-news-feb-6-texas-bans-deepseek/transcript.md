# AI News Feb 6: Texas Bans DeepSeek

two pieces of AI news to call out today number one Greg Abbott governor of Texas has decided to ban deep seek and ban rednote and ban a bunch of other Chinese apps from public issued devices in the state of Texas now you might think well that affects government workers and in your head you're thinking like they go to the governor's mansion they go to some sort of executive administration building with their government issued mobile devices and that's it that's not really it the the problem is that just an executive order not a law Governor Abbott has prevented public education institutions including schools and universities in the state of Texas from accessing or using an AI app and the the larger issue here is that if you are trying to teach students about AI models even if you think something like deep seek isn't the right way to go you don't want to be in a position where they don't have the chance to check it out understand what it is have an intelligent conversation in the classroom about it and that's what's happening you can't do that anymore in Texas and I guarantee you when those students go home on their personal devices they're absolutely more likely to check out deep seek because a lot of headlines got made on it being banned you want to make something popular ban it that's what this country that's what the United States learned in in prohibition we tried to ban alcohol via Constitutional Amendment and it became very very popular right away did not work and in this situation I think as much as it makes sense from a security perspective for certain government employees given the kinds of information collected by deeps and their mobile app the framing of the executive order is really Broad and going after and sort of wrapping in educational institutions is not helpful number two um this one is interesting I don't know if you remember I remember back in the early days it was hard to spell Google and you're like how is this related to AI news it was hard to spell Google two o's 3 O's how do you put it together where do you go to search Google had to overcome all of that now I don't even think about how Google is spelled I've typed it so many times in my life I could probably type it if like I had been you know hit in the head and had a concussion and open AI does not roll off the tongue that way and that matters because open AI is trying to directly come for that kind of muscle memory search Behavior open AI has changed their entire homepage and they have put a search bar on the homepage front and set C right exactly where Google puts theirs they've made it look like Google's they have taken away most of the visual content they used to have on that page it's just a search bar and the only difference is it's in dark mode but it's a search bar and you can use chat GPT for search you don't have to log in you don't have to have an account they're 100% trying to displace Google and the problem is I don't think that they have a consumer friendly name to go and do that I don't think they do open AI people are not going to tell you so they use open AI for search I think what it will do if you're one of the thousands of people who is hearing about chat GPT for the first time and you end up on open AI site there you're going to learn a lot about what it does right away because you can just type right in you don't have to log in you can chat with Chad GPT you can search the web you can get a visceral product experience right there I think that is what they are going for or at least I think that is what they're going to get I think they are aiming for something bigger Sam Alman definitely tweeted and focused mostly on you can search from the homepage now so 100% I think they're coming for Google but I don't think that this particular iteration is going to be successful and I think it's at least at least as much a branding issue as it is anything else open AI is just not a search brand and they've put a lot of work into making it the brand that it is an AI brand and and consumers aren't yet putting together the idea that Ai and search go together and that is going to be a huge huge question mark in the search space for a while and Google is very nervous I guarantee you they are nervous about it even if they are protected by their brand so that's the news for today
