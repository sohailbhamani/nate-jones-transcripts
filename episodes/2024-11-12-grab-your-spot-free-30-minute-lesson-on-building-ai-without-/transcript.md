# Grab Your Spot: Free 30 Minute Lesson on Building AI Without the Hype

On November 20th, I'm going to be doing a free live 30 minute lesson on cutting through the hype and delivering real value with AI. I'll cover things like picking the right problem, picking problems with high leverage. And I'll also be talking about principles for actually building in a landscape that seems to be changing every single day. How do you build when AI is changing all the time? And last but not least, I'll talk about sort of the difference between building for AI workflows versus AI tools, which I think is one of the critical pieces we're missing. So if you want a no BS, straight up look at how to build in 2024 and headed into 2025, you can check it out. It's in a Maven course link, which is right down under my video here. And I hope to see you in class. It's November 20th, 30 minutes. Take 30 minutes, learn about AI. It'll be good. Cheers.
