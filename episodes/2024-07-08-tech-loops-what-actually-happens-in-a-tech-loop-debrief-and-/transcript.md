# Tech loops: what actually happens in a tech loop debrief and how you can win as a candidate

all right I want to take you inside a tech Loop debriefing room and I'm going to do it in depth I did a shorter version of this on the Tik Tok and I think that it's important to understand this because it's one of the most misunderstood stages in Tech hiring and I think that's because most people who participate in interviews have not been in a debrief Loop and there's a magic that happens there that I want to take apart and help you understand so it feels less scary if you're a candidate so the first thing to understand is how a hiring manager constructs a loop what we do is we look to bring in three factors first we want to understand do we have enough signal or coverage from people who will be working closely with this role this could be someone who's appearer this could be someone who is in another job family the point is actually not their level on this one it is how frequently this role is going to need to interact with them and if you think the answer is close to daily then the correct Choice here is actually to make sure that you get good signal from someone who is in that role now at larger companies of course you may have five or six people who are in the role and you have to pick one of them to put on the loop that sort of represents what that role would do with this candidate at smaller companies it's usually just one person you're like hey Bob um please come be on our Loop right uh and one of the things that's actually really challenging about hiring at a smaller company is that the same people have to do a lot of the interviews over and over again you can't really spread it out and because smaller companies also tend to lack sort of recruiting support at the same level as larger companies more of that load is shifted to people who have other jobs within the company and that by the way is one of the reasons why if you're interviewing at a startup it is going to feel more inconsistent sometimes because everyone's doing their best but they also have their regular job just a little side tip there all right so that's the first part of how you construct a loot you want to get people who work closely with a person the second is you want to make sure that you capture feedback and input from people who work with this role less frequently but in a significant way and that is a judgment call because you only have five or six slots so typically you want to have two or three slots from people who will work very closely with this role you want to have the remainder from people who work less frequently with this role and by the way I am intentionally putting senior leadership into that second bucket into the bucket of folks that have a really critical role to play but who will work less frequently with this role obviously if you happen to to be interviewing for say a senior leadership role it's going to look very different because you are going to be interviewing with the CEO or the CTO or you know the head of sales and they will be working with you all the time and so it's going to be like they're all going to be in that closely working bucket but I'm assuming here that you're probably interviewing for a mid senior role uh maybe a director role and it's a little bit more likely that these senior leadership figures are going to interact with you maybe once a week at most at a startup uh maybe less than that and their input is going to be really significant but they're not going to be daily interactors so cycling back out we have the folks you interact with daily you want two or three of those you have the folks you interact with weekly or less you want a nice spread across two or three of those you typically cannot get them all because a good role is going to be interacting with you know 8 nine 10 people on a weekly basis and you have to pick a subset and and a lot of the Judgment in constructing a loop goes into understanding who is the right subset in that bucket right in the bucket of really important to weigh in really important to have an opinion on this role will interact to some degree with this role but probably not every day and you need to have a mix of people who understand the role and especially the role's weak spots like where historically this role has struggled and are able to speak to that like for example if a product manager has historically struggled with sales you want to get a signal on that and so you bring a sales manager in and it might not be about you by the way they might not just construct the loop just for your particular candidacy they do sometimes but oftentimes it's also about what they're looking for in the role maybe the hiring manager has said you know what sales is actually something we really want to address I want to make sure sales is on every single Loop for that reason and that way it's sort of more consistent that's a little bit more common anyway you put it together you make sure you have people with good judgment people who address weaknesses in the role and you might think well then you run the role and you debrief and the hiring manager decides it's not that simple there's actually a script that almost every Loop debrief addresses and goes through in order and I want to break it out for you because I think that if you understand it better you're going to have an easier job figuring out how to represent yourself in the loop okay so what happens number one the job of the hiring manager in the first 10 minutes is to assess the quality of information on the table sometimes this looks like everyone reads everyone's notes there's not often time for that instead the hiring manager's job is usually to read the notes beforehand and to go through and in the first 10 minutes to call out the things they think need to be discussed so they understand the call quality of information this could be a question around two notes from two different interviewers that conflict and so the hiring manager wants to figure out what's going on there it could also be a question around whether or not a particular I want to say flag or yellow flag or red flag is a real issue or is it just something that this person noticed and wants to call out for the sake of completeness because interviewers human too and sometimes they call something out and they themselves probably wouldn't view it as a hiring blocker but they want to be good partners with the hiring manager and so they note it down and so part of the hiring manager's job is to start building that collaborative Loop relationship and to say hey is this something that you're noting down because you're really concerned about it or is and we need to talk about it or is it something that you're noting down just because you think it's important that we be consistent and understand exact what signal you have and that is another piece that is a bit of a Dark Art how people take notes and record notes coming out of interviews is different it's dramatically different for the same role interviewing for the same role so for example if P of sales is interviewing you for a product role it will depend on the individual head of sales what their notes look like in general if you are wondering how did these notes emerge and what happens the more I want to say the more influential a person is in the process with the exception of the hiring manager the shorter their notes will be and the more they will be communicating their opinion verbally and that is one of the nuances that the hiring manager needs to negotiate as they walk through the debrief is who has more information in their head but they've been too busy to write it this will often happen with seite folks where they have a really nuanced perspective on this candidate but they do not have time to write a complete set of notes so they put like three lines down and then you have to sort of tease out what's relevant and have that conversation live and that brings me to the second part so the first part is assessing the quality of information the second part is actually pulling at the ambiguity in the space you want to as a hiring manager push for clarity here you want to really understand what is it that is not clear about this candidacy about the information we have on the table and how yellow are the yellow flags that we see there are almost always yellow flags so if you think you're going to get through an interview with six people and no one is going to have questions I got news for you it ain't happening everybody has yellow flies and so it's not about necessarily a perfect run right and no one having anything negative to say ever it's about figuring out how to represent yourself so that you are clear and consistent about what you can actually do across a wide range of conversations in a way that makes people imagine they can work with you and that matters because at the end of the day one of the things that trips people up the most is they think that they can get away with different stories or different perspectives or even the same anecdote multiple times times with different Loop interviewers and that just isn't true it will come out if you have different conclusions off the same anecdote if you reuse the same anecdote lots of times if you seem like you always want to talk about a particular subject it will come out that is the purpose of the loop and the manager will sus that out and it will not be good so if you're wondering like what are yellow flags that sometimes go through and people don't mind that is where we get to the most interesting part it's usually around 15 20 minutes into the conversation someone is going to ask hiring manager what are you really looking for in this role because they'll have we've got the information on the table we've got some of the yellow flags identified and then it will be on the hiring manager to clarify and reinforce to the rest of the room this is what this particular world needs to do and this is much more nuanced and specific than just well this is a senior product manager and this is what they have to do or this is a product marketing manager and this is what they have to do or this is a you know an sd3 and this is what they have to do it's it's much more like this particular role needs to be really strong with marketing because and then they go through and explain or this particular role needs to demonstrate bias for Action because and then they go through and explain and bigger companies they will actually Define that up front like for example um sometimes at Amazon they'll pick two or three leadership principles that they know this person needs to be really strong at and they'll assess for that throughout the loop they'll get multiple signals on startups tend to do the same thing but they do it more informal but regardless they're looking for a particular fit and if you're wondering how does that cycle into the job description I think I'm going to do a separate video on that this is getting long enough as as it is I want to stay focused on the loop so someone's going to ask what do you want the hiring manager is going to try and be as clear as possible and by the way this is on the hiring manager they have to be clear at this point what they're looking for because if they're wishy-washy you will not get good signal out of this conversation and so the hiring manager needs to be really clear about the nuances of this specific role and that will enable the rest of the group to form an assessment of their own opinion because the the last part of this whole Loop conversation is how much does each person's opinion matter and so everyone came in with an initial opinion everyone came in with some of the information on the table and the hiring manager needs to sort of walk the group through assessing the information calling out the yellow flags understanding what's in the what's in the role and what the nuances are and then finally figure out with a second assessment how much importance should we place on each person's opinion at the table because I have seen hires go through when one person was opposed I have seen hires go through when two people were opposed I've seen rooms flip-flop from 90% in favor at the start of the conversation to 90% opposed and it all happens because you understand what's on the table from an informational perspective you understand what's valuable in the role that's the magical part and then you reassess your opinion and the hiring manager needs to guide through that last bit so that everyone can provide a reassessed perspective often times at tech companies that is like a second vote that is taken sometimes it's less formal than that at smaller companies but it's the spirit of it is the same like you are reassessing your view on the candidate after the information and the conversation that's transpired and so when you reassess the final choice is really up to the hiring manager do they want to move forward with this candidacy and I will tell you as someone who has had to make really tough calls you almost almost never move forward if there is any there's two two situations I will say one is if there's any kind of strong no so if anyone on the loop is like this is a big red flag for me I would be strongly opposed to this and they're very clear about it and they understand why and it ties into your definition of the role almost never happens that you move forward even if you technically could because you know that you're setting this person up for failure because they're going to have to work with someone who's opposed to them being there number two if no one is a strong yes and so if you walk through at the end of the time and everyone gives their opinion and most people are like yeah you know it's okay like I think probably it would fit and maybe you go through the nuances of the role and yeah probably it would fit but no one's excited about this person no one can find a specific reason why that particular person is clearly a fit well that's almost always a no as well because you're looking for a strong yes because otherwise the risk is too high and what I mean by that is part of your job in hiring is to vet for passion you're vetting for passion for this particular role and sometimes like I people will tell me they get really frustrated by that and I get it but finding authentic passion for a role gets more and more important the more senior you get and it's less and less acceptable to not have that passion because if you don't have that you're not going to bring the Cure curiosity you're not going to bring the drive that you need to solve really hard problems intact and that's why they look for passion so if you want to succeed where where are we wrapping up here right if you want to succeed through a loop process that looks like that we we're stepping away we've seen the inside of the loop deep brief what are the takeaways for you number one be clear and consistent I think I said it earlier in this talk but you got to be clear and consistent in your takeaways your perspective your philosophy your approach to the role if you're not and you're just guessing it the inconsistency will come out number two do not be excessively repetitive don't mistake consistency for being repetitive they're different things if you use the same story over and over again it's just one of the easiest things to fly number three build genuine connection with the people on your loop I don't mean like find out what dog they like and stock them on the internet I mean find ways to to connect with them that help them feel like they are your future colleagues so that could look like you know trading stories about the weather if it feels like that's natural at the top of the conversation and then you kind of get into hobbies that are Outdoors who knows it can also look like work it can also look like talking about the craft and the challenges of the job in a way that both of you find interesting and both of you find really engaging if you find the conversation flowing with with multiple interviewers in a loop that's usually a really good sign another one that I think is really important to take away is you need to have confidence in yourself that this process is designed to help you find a fit and so if you come through is excessively nervous it's not that people will penalize you for the nervousness it's that the nervousness will obscure the signal of your candidacy so think about ways that you can intentionally relax do breathing exercises something whatever works for you because if you can be a little bit more relax and a little bit more confident that this process is designed to get signal on your candidacy in a way that makes sense for both parties then you will be able to be at your best you will be able to convey who you really are and that is the highest quality way that you can increase your chances to get the role convey what your skill set really is convey what the nuances of that skill set are through the stories that you tell convey your leveling by talking about the impact of what you bring to the table build genuine connections with people on each of the interviews in the loop as much as you can that's your best shot and also ask good questions I may do a separate video on that ask good questions that help the interviewer imagine what it's like to work with you yeah that sounds like another video we'll do another video all right this has gone on long enough that's how you construct a loop as a hiring manager that's how you do a debrief on a loop so if you've never been in one that's what it's like and finally those are the tips that you need to succeed if you are participating in a loop all right I'll see you next time
