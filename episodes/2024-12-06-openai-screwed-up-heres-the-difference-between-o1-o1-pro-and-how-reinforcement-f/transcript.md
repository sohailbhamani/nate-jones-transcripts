# OpenAI Screwed Up: Here's the Difference Between o1, o1 Pro, and how Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Fits

open AI messed up their launch of 01 and I want to talk about it because I think we need to set the record straight on what 01 is on what 01 Pro is and on where they're going with their newest release which was today called reinforcement fine-tuning so we're going to get to all three of those and unpack that 01 is the model they have been teasing for months they should have just released that yesterday that would have been big enough news on its own just release 01 tell people very clearly that 01 goes in plus and team plans and then get out that is the correct launch for the day and the reason why is because then people would know where to find the model you are launching most of the people I know who are not obsessive industry Watchers are asking me and saying Nate why do I have to pay $200 for 01 well you don't but open AI confused Everyone by ALS so dropping a second surprise new model yesterday at the same time as this much B hooded model 01 they called it 01 Pro which is even more confusing because now they're both named 01 what which one do you mean and then they deleted 01 preview without telling anybody now it's fine to delete 01 preview and just put in 01 I think that would have made sense but adding two new o1s is extremely confusing so 01 Pro costs $200 and everyone I know who knows that there is a difference which is already sort of a small segment of the population is asking why does it matter because if you look at the benchmarking test papers and I was up late last night doing that it does not look like a very big jump over 01 but it feels like a big jump over 01 for the right kind of task and that is what open AI has done a poor job calling out and I think they've done a poor job calling that out over 40 as well because most of the folks on my Tik Tok in the comments are saying why do I go to 01 I tried 01 I found it in my plus plan it doesn't seem that much different I will tell you it doesn't seem different if you are using it for the same easy tasks if you're using it for more complex tasks it's an absolute lifechanger I'll give you an example I fed 01 40 and Claud Sonet 3.5 an 1800w essay in one prompt and I gave it the exact same to the word instructions I said read the essay come back to me with a critique to make it better and that critique must fit inside an iPhone screen one screen capture size I did not give it the size of the iPhone I none of that just fit it inside an iPhone screen well only one model could do it 01 could do it that's it all the others failed miserably I asked 01 mini I asked 40 I asked Cloud son at 3.5 all of them were way too wordy and had critiques that just stretched on and on and on it was difficult to make sense of and it wasn't that they were wrong like Sonet 3.5 had good points 40 was okay but when I read the cinct inside one iPhone size response from 01 I felt like I was talking to a senior stakeholder with 15 years of experience in the industry I was shocked it is incredible but if I had asked it to do a really simple prompt like say hey help me brainstorm for a meeting here's three bullets would it have really done a much better job than 40 probably not in a measurable way like probably a little bit better the tone would have been better subtly better that's not what it's for the models that we are developing V oping are solving harder tasks than most of us have to solve and so you need to recognize in your work what model you really need if you are just doing day-to-day work 40 or Sonet 3.5 is probably as much power as you need if you are deliberately solving complex problems and you want a one-hot response and you're willing to write a precise prompt 01 is incredible and 01 Pro is even better but for an even smaller range of use cases I saw a demo on 01 Pro today where they gave 01 Pro and 01 and 40 and some others the same prompt clone the coinbase front page and only 01 Pro was able to produce a highquality production ready piece of code that was designed gorgeously and perfectly functional with no bugs in one response everybody else was way off base by comparison so 01 Pro I mean if 01 is a BMW 01 Pro is a Ferrari but you can only put a Ferrari on a small percentage of the roads without banging it up and so what I'm encouraging you to do is what open ai's marketing team should have done in the first place which is dig in and understand these models and if you want to learn more about the models and how you leverage them for workflows I am doing a free lightning lesson I will put the link in the description you can sign up for it it's on December 19th I think it's the these are incredible models I don't want to take away from the technical achievement of open AI here just because they dropped the marketing these are amazing and I want people to understand what they can do and how to use them to to drive workflows and multiply their value in 2025 so if that if that all that sounds interesting to you have a maven lesson you can learn live from me 30 minutes it'll be fun December 19th and before we go I want to call out that there is a connection between the Pro Plan and the reinforcement fine-tuning that we got today because the Pro Plan is aimed at scientists and so is reinforcement fine tuning reinforcement fine tuning is aimed at high value Enterprise researchers who want to dig in a ton on specific highly technical problems again this is a Ferrari of a technique it is not for everybody you do not need it on average there's a reason they put it on a weight list that's what it's about and I think we're going to get more and more like heavy duty models that offer incredible value but only for very specific cases all right cheers
