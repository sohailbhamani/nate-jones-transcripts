# Product Strategy: 3 product problems where we usually set the bar too low to be successful

we spend way too little time setting the bar high for good products and I want to say that because I think a lot of times we think to ourselves we just need to survive to the next software release and that is not what this post is about this post is asking you this video is challenging you to step back and look at your product problems strategically I'm going to give you three product types I'm going to ask you which one you're working on we're going to talk about the bar for success for each the first one is the wash the dishes problem it's a heavy manual process you are up to your elbows in soap you're scrubbing the tomato sauce off of the plate the correct solution and there the correct bar for the solution is 10x easier the dishwasher is at least 10x easier than washing the dishes manually I put the dishes in I put the soap in it's done that is it that's the whole solution so easy I forget about it we do not set that bar high enough in software I see too many times where there's a heavy frictional process maybe it's manual data wrangling of some sort and people brag about the fact that their solution makes it 20% easier that is not good enough it's not if you are dealing with something that is a wash the dishes problem where it's a heavy manual piece of work in the workflow you must make it at least 10 times easier to truly Drive adoption because there is a ton of switching cost because it's expensive to get a new workflow into your head it is expensive in dollars to pay for the software it is expensive to train people factor that in and they will not switch it is not substantially easier and I think 10 times easier is a good bar for that problem number two it's called the new car problem how do you sell a vehicle to someone who has a vehicle it's with a product feature that adds functionality that they didn't know they needed till they saw it because to be honest with you e-commerce as an example didn't feel broken until Amazon introduced Prime when they introduced Prime and it was two days shipping suddenly everybody else felt slow that's an example of solving a new car kind of problem where you don't have the problem until you see the solution it's a really hard one because your customers won't tell you if you were listening to your customers and you're like I'm listening to what they say I'm only building what they say and you are solving a problem that is basically a new car problem you're never going to win you won't get there by listening to your customers and I know that's weird to say because I love customers I love chatting with customers but in this case if what you are trying to build is something that surprises and delights them with a feature set they didn't know they needed till they saw it you have to use your imagination the bar there is something that makes someone who isn't in Tech go oh wow that's so cool I have to try that and if that's what you're building and you're not delivering that bar you are not not going to succeed you're going to have a lot of trouble driving adoption because fundamentally that kind of pain point for customers is one they can live with they everyone feels like they can live with the world that exists until a better one is shown to them and so if you come back and you're like you know what let's let's play this tape out Prime is going to be five day shipping instead of no one's really wow no one's really excited by that even if it's guaranteed five instead of seven it doesn't get close enough to instantaneous that people's imaginations are sparked and so it took something that was a bold commitment like two-day shipping to actually get people to think differently to get people's imaginations going to change the nature of e-commerce and I think we don't challenge ourselves enough in that regard either I talked in the first example of how we set the bar too low on dishwasher problems I think we set the bar too low on these problems around I call them new car problems basically what is the feature set that makes you want to buy the new car when you have the car anyway it's something that Delights you it's a surprise and Delight problem and we just think a little bit of delight will go a long way and the truth is oftentimes you really have to give someone a wow moment to make this kind of problem solved right that's problem number two new car problem surprise and Delight problem what have you number three is a platform problem where fundamentally there is a desire to use a particular tool that exists but at the end of the day you don't have the combination of software Hardware the tool set in place to get what you want done and what's interesting about that is it's not just for businesses you might think businesses are the ones that use tools to get jobs done but consumers do too my favorite example here is actually the classic example of the iPhone consumers had phones before iPhone was certainly not the first in the market they weren't the second or the fourth or the fifth they were very late to Market but what they brought was a platform that let you get stuff done it was so effective it spawned multiple billion dollar companies like Instagram and that would not have happened if they had not taken the time to build a coherent experience where this felt like a single effective tool to spend your day on and now we complain about that with our phones but the point is people want wanted to use their phones to do more than their phones were letting them do before and they needed a platform that was going to make the phone disappear so they could focus on the task and that is one of the key success criteria for an effective platform if you stop talking about it and you just start focusing on the task at hand that's fantastic I saw a really interesting take actually that the reason we don't dream about our phones is because our phones mentally disappear when we're working on them and we don't think about the device we think about the task and I think that's a wonderful analogy of the importance of building good platforms so you might not have a new car problem you might not have a dishwasher problem maybe what you have is a platform problem where what you need is to build something that is a single unified tool set that lets someone get the job done and it's so effective it just disappears if that's the case then coherence is the bar you're looking for everything in that experience has to knit and fit together and if it doesn't there are going to be janky edges that make it really difficult for people to use that tool to get their work done and people are going to get frustrated and that is going to dramatically lower usage and one of the things platform tools need to succeed is regular usage iPhone would not have worked if you went there and used your phone in the store and then used it for 30 days afterward and forgot about it iPhone works as a product because it is woven into your life as it's a successful platform and that is the marker for successful platforms is the way you use and reuse them and if you're solving for that kind of utility you need to solve for smooth coherent edges on that experience everywhere you look workflows have to be knitted together and end to end every time because your goal is that no one thinks about the platform they just think about getting their job done and again I see people bragging about additional featur teachers they added to a platform and they don't think about the platform as a whole and that is one of those strategic errors that means that so many of the platforms we use are too frictional they're tiring to use we talk about them because they aren't fun they're exhausting maybe we can get the work done but it's not not any fun to use we don't recommend it to people and that slows adoption for the companies that build these kinds of platforms so if that's you if you are working on a platform make sure that you are thinking about the whole experience it is worth it to think end to end there is no substitute for that okay so the three things we talked about the dishwasher problem you have to set that bar high on automation the new car problem you have to make sure you are finding a surprise and Delight that genuinely makes people go wow and this last one the platform problem it's all about coherence can the workflows be endtoend coherent I hope you enjoyed this um I certainly had fun talking about it I don't think we talk about product and problem types enough let me know if you have other problem types you'd like me to go into I thought this was a fun introduction but there's always more to go after all right cheers
