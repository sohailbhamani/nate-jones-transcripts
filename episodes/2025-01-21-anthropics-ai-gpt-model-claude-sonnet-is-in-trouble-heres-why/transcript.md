# Anthropic's AI GPT Model Claude Sonnet is in Trouble: Here's Why

I want to talk about Dario amade and anthropic today Dario gave a fairly significant speech about AI at the deos Summit in Switzerland and to me it read like anthropic is in a little bit of a difficult situation so I want to unpack the speech I want to talk about my analysis of it and if you think unpacking a speech is boring I got to say these are major model makers and what they say shapes the world that we all live in so I don't think it's that boring number one he said a million gpus for anthropic by 2026 if you think a million is a lot it is a lot not that many models are even trained at over 100,000 gpus right now so claiming a million is a big number the problem is the timing 2026 is a long way away if you think about it the end of 2026 is two years away he's leaving himself a lot of room there and he's making no promises in between if you look at like his claims on intelligence it's sort of I I I know this sounds silly like it's the same old stuff human level intelligence by about 2027 that's about what a lot of people are saying I think that open ai ai on average is a little bit more optimistic at this point uh but regardless it's coming soon it's a big deal I think as weird as it is we're all getting used to that idea and then if you bring in the timeline if you come closer to the present he only makes three real statements one is that voice mode is coming for Claude well that's like that's not new Gemini has voice mode uh you know open AI has voice mode and Claude has been living off of two things for people who like Claud one is the ability to code well which is why it's the default for cursor and one is this weird sort of intuition that it has when you talk to it and you chat with it I don't quite know what it is but I find Claude more intuitive than any other model I talk to but that doesn't make it better at reasoning and he doesn't have a reasoning model and reasoning is where the Cutting Edge is right now and so you might think well maybe he talked about reasoning and he didn't really he just said a quote unquote smarter model is going to be released in the coming months which again months is a long time in this world we're used to a world where new models drop almost every week and so I read that and I think to myself you know he's under a lot of pressure deep think got released with extremely good coding just yesterday 03 mini also supposed to be extremely good and extremely fast at coding is coming out in the next week or so and the best he can do is a smarter model in the coming months he's under a lot of pressure I do wonder if the demand for Claude right now from cursor is keeping anthropic from releasing a new model because they don't have the compute to actually offer the model at scale it's it's a guess but it's not an unreasonable guess now the ironic thing is developers are not particularly loyal to models and so if indeed they think that deep think is going to do a better job coding or 03 mini will do a better job coding they'll switch they'll switch and that will ease the pressure on anthropic and then anthropic will have more space to release but will'll also be even further behind which is sort of My overall takeaway at the end of the day this is a CEO who is having to make a speech because he has nothing substantive to release and that is a problem in this world with the model makers that is a big problem grock 3 is coming 03 full is coming and looks like it will now be released before they do anything at this pace and thropic is in trouble a little bit so we'll see where they end up but I'm a little bit worried cheers
