# New OpenAI Paper Explains how Reinforcement Learning Enabled o3 to be a top 50 coder

so a few days ago open A's 03 model did very well in a coding challenge I think it's now ranked top 50 in the world anyway they release their paper showing how they did it and the interesting thing is that the way they trained the model is not specific to coding it was a generalized 03 model that did very well and they called out that the reinforcement learning that they used to make a model generally good at coding so it could accomplish a particular code Force challenge is something that could be applied in other business contexts basically anywhere in business or in other spheres in life where you could actually have a true or false response to a model either the model got the answer right or the model got the answer wrong you had the opportunity through this reinforcement learning technique to make the model more effective and so if you think about reinforcement learning as a way of giving structure and verifiable rewards for business tasks this paper from openi unlocks a lot of other pieces for example you could look at Investment Portfolio optimization that might not seem like it's binary but you can very clearly tell when something is a correct portfolio versus a portfolio that is under optimized or under Diversified sales funnel optimization and Lead scoring you can clearly tell when a lead is scored incorrectly or not and you can measured over time by deal propensity to close in financial forecasting or in loan underwriting you can see if the loan goes bad or not and you can see if the underwriting was correct or not and then you can start to optimize accordingly over time supply chain Logistics you can look at kpis like routing warehousing inventory replenishment and see if you made the optimal decision add bidding optimization and marketing similarly basically anywhere in business where you can say this was done correctly or this was done incorrectly reinforcement learning can enable you to build a model or train a model or F tuna model so that you can effectively use AI to accomplish that task and I'm not saying that you should take that and go out tomorrow and find tuna model and it will be as good as 03 is but I am saying if you look ahead six months if you look at where models are going think of these domains as being domain means that models can learn quickly and that they are likely to learn quickly as they become more intelligent in other words what open ai's paper showed is the areas in business where models can do useful work and are likely to start doing useful work in the near term and I think that's a really important Insight cheers
