# ChatGPT 4.5 explained: OpenAI product strategy, model pricing and feature breakdown

Chad GPT 4.5 dropped today like an hour or so ago and we're going to talk about the strategy because a lot of people are confused and frankly they're confused for good reason to start with 4.5 is expensive and I can put dollars on that because they price it per million tokens Claude 3.7 Sonet which is another model that dropped very recently it dropped like three days ago it comes in at an output cost of $115 per million tokens and an input cost like sending something in at three bucks per million tokens by comparison chat GPT 4.5 which dropped today output cost is 10 times more $150 per million tokens the input cost is $75 per million token Which is vastly higher than three bucks it's huge the input cost is 25 times more the higher computational costs are real it's so real that Sam Alman could not release this to anyone except Pro Plan users right now plus is going to have to wait apparently they're adding tens of thousands of gpus which makes it really funny that Nvidia fell like eight or 10% or whatever it was today because like he's literally talking about how much compute he has to add to serve this model and people are like why would you put all this work in to a more expensive model when it doesn't reason because 01 Pro reasons 03 reasons Claude 3.7 Sonet is this hybridized model it reasons it doesn't reason depending on what you need it's focused on code which is a high value use case I'll tell you why the play here is a legol block play chat GPT is a market leader it is not a challenger Claude is a challenger Claude needs to specialize Claude is specializing in code chat GPT is a market leader and needs to cover all the bases to lead the market that means they cannot Just Produce deep research they cannot Just Produce 01 Pro for inference and win they have to produce a model that does everything to earn the user base they have which is the only user base in the hundreds of millions they're the only ones and so they have to do everything well and what this is designed to do well is new nuan stuff that isn't captured on benchmarks but which chat GPT thinks is a long-term building block to their success they are highlighting emotional intelligence they are highlighting nuanced writing style the ability to surprise you these are things that don't show up in an aim eval but they do show up in real world interactions for users and the long-term bet is that they can bring the compute cost down they can hybridize this with the other models that they already have in the stable and they can produce a gp5 by Q2 that has emotional intelligence built in thanks 4.5 and has the other pieces as well has the reasoning piece has all this other stuff and so if you're judging 4.5 by what is released today you are probably not judging it correctly you need to look at chat GPT 4.5 as the last Lego block in place to build something that is much more compelling and sticky as a customer experience for chat GPT long term and so chat GPT 567 whatever that's going to be is dependent on getting these complex Primitives right and arguably from the compute cost emotional intelligence nuance and the ability to surprise you is extremely compute intensive and that doesn't really shock me these seem like really hard things for a machine to do if a machine can do this very well that's a really big deal that is genuinely novel that is an achievement that is really significant even if it's hard to measure and so that is what Sam is doing with GPT 4.5 it exemplifies yet again why it's important to have real world evaluations and real world conversations about performance and capabilities because these benchmarks are just not good enough these benchmarks don't tell us these things and so we're going to have to all get used to this another good example is Cloud 3.7 people are talking about the fact that it is built to be more opinionated with code that is a designed decision it is a designed decision that does not show up on evals but it's really important and you can disagree with it you can say you want a more malleable model and you really want to use 3.5 sonnet or you can agree with it and say I like the structure this provides I like that it insists on a particular sort of way of building code and I think that that helps me to build quicker because the scaffolding is in place you can have opinions but you need to know what the model does to have those opinions and we do not have other than like digging in and talking about it in places like this good ways to do that we need better evals anyway that's GPT 4.5 that's the strategy that's what's coming you try it out if you're in the Pro Plan and let me know it's only in the Pro Plan right now it's coming to the plus plan next week cheers
