# July 2024 AI Tech News: the strategy behind the Q3 earnings headlines for chips and cloud

sometimes the news cycle happens so fast it's hard to keep track and certainly hard to put the pieces together this post is focused specifically on putting the pieces together around three big pieces of news that broke in the last couple of days at the very end of July in 2024 I'm going to list the pieces of news very quickly first and then we're going to talk about the relationship between them and what it says about this point in the AI cycle number one AMD did very very well in their latest earnings release their revenue for their GPU chips division which is where people go to get chips if they're buying from AMD for machine learning if they're buying from AMD in particular for large language model training which is a lot of where this chip purchase demand comes from that's surprised to the upside by half a billion dollars they made half a billion dollars more than they expected to make from their GPU division Wall Street was super happy had a great quarter in fact they increased their guidance for the future because they think this is going to keep happening all right that's the first piece of news second piece of news Microsoft got punished in the markets yesterday when they also reported earnings not because the earnings were particularly out of line with expectations there was a tiny bit of deceleration in their Cloud Revenue by uh one or two percentage points which does matter at their scale and in particular there was a significant reported annual increase in capital expenditure which Microsoft has been telegraphing all year long by having giant conferences and saying we're spending a lot on training data centers and hey we're going to build a nuclear power plant and all all kinds of things but at the end of the day it does come down to Dollars and cents for Wall Street and Wall Street looked at the 60% increase in capital expenditure and then looked over at the cloud revenue and really didn't see a corresponding acceleration in Revenue that could be driven by that capital expenditure in Ai and Wall Street got worried and so Microsoft took a bit of a hit that's the second piece of news the third piece of news is around Ai and regulation it's from across the pond so August 1st tomorrow is when the eui ACT goes into effect it's designed to prohibit or control or regulate many many different kinds of AI models and it goes in a phase roll out over time the language appears to be relatively Broad and I am not the only one who doesn't know exactly what it means uh in fact very large companies with lotss of very well-paid lawyers also don't know enough about what it means to be confident in their AI approach in the European Union for example meta has decided not to roll out their AI capabilities for search you know that little blue circle if you live in the US where you type it in and it will sort of do AI search we kid about it because it's not always useful in the US but the EU doesn't get to kid about it because they don't get it at all because meta decided to depos it because of the the uncertainty around the AI act all right those are the three pieces of news what does it mean how do these go together so the first takeaway I have is that this remains a year when the companies that are selling the first part of the value chain are the ones that are doing well Nvidia has reported really strong earnings this year AMD is now reporting really strong earnings this is what people are uh calling the picks and shovels part of the Gold Rush where you are just selling the equipment that enables everybody else to do what they do with AI and you were doing very well on Revenue as a result the capital expenditure that Microsoft was reporting shows up on chipmakers balance sheets in their case I think they're using primarily Nvidia but the point stands right fundamentally the money that is an expense for a software company building out cloud is a revenue for the chip makers and so all of those chip makers are having great years they're all surprising to the upside they all have strong guidance like there's all of this sort of momentum in the chip space and that is exactly what we would expect in the first part of a larger value chain that's unlocking for AI That's not a surprise it shouldn't be a surprise if you've been watching AI what's interesting to ask yourself is when that part of the acceleration curve levels off and the signals we're getting both from the manufacturers of chips themselves and from their customers are that this is not leveling off in the next couple of years and that's why everyone's so excited about chip manufacturers it looks like they have a great Market they've stumbled into basically making making chips for the greatest technological project that Humanity May ever work on with this whole artificial general intelligence thing that's not the topic of this video but that's what people are thinking about right and that's the kind of investment Horizon they have what if we invent into a general intelligence we'd pay anything for it that's what's driving the appetite Etc so they're doing well the chip manufacturers and it's interesting because they're doing well even though the software companies that buy their chips know that they are in for a beating in the markets for spending that much on AI and they just don't care because they think it's so important so Google meta were actually leaked to have leaking memos uh back and forth a couple week weeks ago basically saying they know they are overspending by billions of dollars on AI and from a game theory perspective they would rather be all in on AI versus risk a catastrophic loss of business if they miss the boat on this AI Revolution so they're overspending on purpose and that includes overspending potentially on chips which is great if you're selling chips which is what AMD is doing so this kind of brings us to Microsoft they're also in that same sort of game Game Theory position where they need to establish a strong Cloud product that is AI driven they have this startup that is the darling of the world and open AI that they're also helping to prop up and support and they need to spend like crazy to make sure that they maintain their position uh across their Azure division across open Ai and sort of the model development curve and that's what they've been signaling they're going to spend spend spend spend span there was a picture on a slide that the CTO of Microsoft gave that basically was like these are the the size of our models and it was different animals right and it was like you know hey look here's you know a a shark and here's an orca whale and here's this freaking big gray whale over here and they're basically saying these models are going to get bigger which means bigger and bigger and bigger chips uh or bigger and bigger chips uh sizes in in data centers right more and more count of chips in data centers and that all translates into exponentially growing revenue for the for the chip side the problem for the markets is that the founders the CEOs of these companies are thinking in much much longer time Horizons than street so Wall Street is like is is liking you know 12 18mth Roi they feel like they've given these companies plenty of leash to go ahead and produce results from Ai and look at this they haven't really seen a gain in Revenue well if you work in Tech you know actually rolling out AI applications takes a ton of work actually getting AI Enterprise is really hard and in many cases it's going to take a long time for a full incremental Revenue shift to actually translate into the bottom line or even the top line for a company like Microsoft lots of companies are doing AI experimentation AI demand which the CFO actually called out on the call is exceeding their capacity despite their 60% SP uh increase in capex so they are seeing tremendous this demand they say which I believe for their AI services but that demand isn't necessarily at the scaled application stage and what it suggests to me is they're investing a huge amount just to get to that sort of initial experimentation phase just to get to the idea of rolling out these applications over time and I have two thoughts there one the investment Horizon needs to be longer if you're actually looking at AI value and that something that the CEOs in these large companies seem to recognize and Wall Street doesn't it's going to be 36 it's going to be 48 months it's going to be much longer than the street typically tolerates and so I would expect to see continued frustration from Wall Street towards some of these Executives as they see the larger opportunity long term five seven years out and the street doesn't look at it that way they look at the quarters this happened famously with Amazon where Jeff Bezos when he started the company basically told Wall Street don't look for profits anytime soon I'm just not going to produce them I'm going to work on scaling the business and that's sort of the position that we're in now what's interesting is that the software side of the business is the next one we would expect to catch up after the chips are starting to sort of fully built out you know after the revenue is done from AMD from Nvidia and I I don't want to say done in the sense that they're not going to continue to spend on chips all the signs are that they are for the next you know or two years here at least but when you have purchased a chip you then have to put it into a model at a data center get the model to train across a data set using that chip and then at that point you can finally use it but then you have to have a separate runtime application environment and a separate runtime Cloud Center where you can run it at scale and so there's a whole another piece of capital expenditure that goes into sort of running the model enabling retrieval all of that so it's a whole of upfront expense and then when you're running it it's not clear whether the monetization that you're offering is going to be truly incremental across an Enterprise's Cloud spend or not is it something where a big company like Walmart is going to say my total Cloud spend is X I'm going to pay X+ y because of AI and I'm willing to tolerate a growing expense in my cloud footprint even if every anything else in my environment is really margin competitive or are they going to say you know what this is not really worth it I want to make sure that my Revenue overall or that my spend overall on cloud stays flat that's Microsoft's revenue and I will put AI in but I'll negotiate out negotiate out a bunch of other things like is AI effectively replacing things on the balance sheet now what's interesting is that we won't necessarily know that for a few Quarters here my hunch is that eventually it's going to be incremental and you're going to still see Cloud revenues rise and I think the question for Microsoft is and for for Amazon and for Google these all run huge clouds is whether the rise that you see is going to be enough to re accelerate their enormous Cloud businesses so their Cloud businesses famously tend to run at double- digigit growth per year 20% 25 30 whatever uh and the point is are they going to have enough incremental growth to re accelerate those businesses so instead of it being you know 25 this year and 24 the next year and 23 the year after that is it 25 27 29 32 right like are you seeing this acceleration curve in Revenue growth because there's so much demand for AI that is certainly what Wall Street is hoping for they always look for that sort of accelerating Revenue picture it is increasingly hard to deliver as your business gets larger and larger I will be curious to see how it plays out it is not at all clear to me even if Revenue grows net net whether revenue is going to grow faster and faster for these large Cloud companies based on AI or whether it's going to essentially prop up and enable continued scale up of existing Cloud resources existing Cloud divisions at these companies we will have to see stepping back what you're seeing is the chip side selling the Pix and shovels in the Gold Rush doing very well today you're seeing immense capital expenditure from these cloud providers which is sort of the next piece in the value chain that corresponds to revenue for the chips people and then from there what you really need to see is that there is a corresponding Revenue guidance increase in the End customer we're a long way from that but if they're going to spend more using AI on these Cloud providers ultimately the only reason they will do that is if they believe their revenue and their customer experience and everything else about their Core Business is going to substantially improve it's going to improve enough to be worth the AI spent it is not at all clear yet when that will happen and so I see this in three phases right we're in solidly in phase one where we see this huge chips Revenue increase phase two is a question mark we see the spend side on data centers for companies like Microsoft we do not yet see the revenue side come through and then phase three is end companies companies like Walmart other companies that are consumer facing or business facing that are consumers of the cloud they need to start to come through and say AI is going to deliver this kind of value in our business and so we're spending more on it that hasn't really happened yet either and I'm keeping an eye out for it we should start to see it in the next year or two here if we're going to start to see this value chain for AI play out the way people are hoping last but not least let's talk about the EU piece at the end of the day this is an environment where we are seeing some of the fastest technological change in history even fast by Silicon Valley standards it is so fast it is hard to deploy on a lot of AI tool chains right now it's just really tricky because they keep updating them all the time so in that environment you need to have a regulatory space that enables The Innovation to happen and that is the piece that the EU is saying we're going to take a stance on early and that's very typical of the EU they tend to sort of regulate first and think about permissiveness after and I'm not saying that in a pajora of sense that's just sort of how they've approached things that they how they approached it with gdpr we have worries about privacy so we're going to make sure that we catch that early and we're not going to let it happen to our people and then figure out the regulations later so the US has a different approach the us if it regulates at all in these spaces tends to regulate after the fact and it tends to regulate in in broadly speaking in a more corporate friendly way and so what you're seeing is that when the technological pace of changes really fast when the future is uncertain when you have to put big bets down and you're intentionally playing effectively um a game theory arms race with other major tech companies you want to be sure that you're not multiplying your uncertainty you want to make sure that you are limiting your uncertainty to the already immense risks associated with the actual AI capex expenditure you're making so it is irrational in that environment if you were a major Company CEO to go out and say I'm going to multiply my Risk by rolling out this very expensive model in a place where my lawyers can't be exactly sure what is going to happen over the next two or three years in the AI space in that regulatory environment and that is the reason why meta decided to not roll out their AI in the EU but what that means for EU businesses is that they are going to lose some of the AI cont context that they need to be competitive on a global level so if you're running a business in the EU and your American counterpart would have access to AI modeling and uh AI Services it is not at all clear that you will have the same kinds of access because of the regulatory environment and that access is changing so fast because we're innovating so fast that there is an increased risk that you as an EU business owner using AI may get get more left behind now that's not a guarantee you do have a major AI player in mrr that is based in France so there is definitely a AI startup activity in the EU I don't want to take that away at all but the uncertainty is making American companies more cautious about moving into the EU and that is going to affect the long-term competitive picture for tech companies in Europe in ways that we don't fully understand and all of it is stemming from some sort of uncertainty around how these regulations will roll out and take effect in the face of this overwhelmingly fast uh technological Revolution that we're all living through okay that's a lot all from three key pieces of news that came out in the last day or two around AMD around Microsoft around EU I hope the breakdown was helpful to you I hope you feel like you understand a little bit better some of the underlying drivers that are shaping the world that we are all living in with they are let me know what you think in the comments h
