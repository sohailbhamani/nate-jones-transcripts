# When C-Suite FAILS at AI: 9 Mistakes CEOs Make and How to Avoid Multi-Million Dollar AI Disasters

It seems like AI adoption fails more often than it goes right. I want to take today's video and talk specifically about the nine different AI failure patterns that I've seen in organizations over the last few months in 2025. I want to get at not just what happened, but what is the root cause? What are the things that make that pattern sticky, that fail pattern sticky, and then what is the actual fix that unsticks an organization and gets it back on track. I don't think we talk enough about the categories of AI adoption failure and I want to lay them out really cleanly so that we have a vocabulary to talk about them to address them and ultimately to get back on track. Let's start with number one, the integration tarpet. Let's say engineering ships working AI code in weeks, but sales and legal and compliance cycles were never meant to run that fast. They stretch into months or longer. Cross team stakeholder meetings are multiplying all over the business talking about policies and approvals. The root cause here is that the organization's budget for AI development was structured in terms of dollars and cents and not in terms of coordination cost. When you are working with a prototype, it's very simple. But a prototype does not equal a system that fits data architecture, compliance, and politics together. Yes, organizational politics are relevant. So why is this sticky? Everyone assumes if it works technically then deployment is going to be easy but integration complexity becomes visible only after the build is is complete right you can see it working you can see that deployment is easy executives tend to not understand why it's not being used why we're stuck on paper the committees will make sense the IT policy will make sense and none of it actually delivers value the fix is pretty simple take approval paths take policy paths as critically as you take writing code. You want to fix and pre-wire in how you are fasttracking adoption through the organization before you jump in and start just saying we can ship this thing quickly. Treat the human problem as significant as the code problem. you want to assign someone, maybe it's a deployment PM whose entire job separate from the engineering piece is just to say, do we have all of our ducks in a row process-wise to actually get this into people's hands? Do we have data support and approval? Do we have legal clearance? Do we have any concerns around compliance we need to address? Do we have any concerns from HR that we need to address? They're not asking, does the model work? That needs to be somebody else's job. All they're trying to do is to wrangle the stakeholders and move them quickly along. You have to budget for the organizational side to get out of the integration tarpet. There is no shortcut. Failure number two, governance vacuum. Let's say red teams find vulnerabilities. We actually had that happen this week with teams finding vulnerabilities in AI powered browsers. Security will flag an unapproved architecture when a red team vulnerability is found, but there's no owner for what happens if AI does something. And so in this situation, if your ordinary red team, your ordinary security issues are triggered by AI, you often run into a governance issue. Really, there's no one who's a directly responsible individual who treats AI governance as a first class object. And that is your core problem. That is why when small vulnerabilities are sometimes found in your agentic systems, you get stuck. When they're found in your implementation of a custom chat GPT, you get stuck. You have to treat governance as a first class object. And that is especially true if you are in a high compliance industry. And here's the trick. You probably knew that if you were in high compliance. But what you may not have realized is that the skill set for governance and AI is different from the skill set for a lot of typical IT security projects. And that is why this problem is sticky because people often try and address it by saying let's give it a security review. Let's give it a software review. That feels like bureaucratic slowdown. It looks like bureaucratic slowdown. The teams that are addressing it don't have the tools to do it right. So teams just kind of go hands off and one incident ends up freezing everything. A governance vacuum ends up grinding your system to a halt. The fix is simple. You need to embed the right talent with the right tools to make security a day zero problem. That means that you have to think about what the AI agent can access, what it does, what its blast radius is, what failure modes look like, how you architect security rather than making security the agents problem with decisioning, how you can reliably evaluate whether the agent is doing the right thing, how you test in production systems a range of utterances or words from the user that let you know that if there are things the system should not be responding to, prompt injection attacks, etc. You can prove that you're addressing them correctly at the desired rate of success. If you don't make all of that somebody's problem, and it is again not a traditional security software purview. It's a new set of skills, you're going to be in trouble. Failure number three, the review bottleneck. AI will generate output so fast. I've talked about this before, but human review doesn't get shorter just because AI gets longer. And so output quality starts to vary super wildly. and engineers or other job families end up babysitting AI systems. The root cause here is that you have stuck AI as an engine onto the wrong part of your workflow, generation instead of judgment. So, organizations will usually measure success by how much you can produce. And so, the instinct is to just stick a bolt-on engine of AI generation onto the generative part of your process. Maybe it's making social media stuff. Maybe it's writing documents or breaking out tickets. Maybe it's writing code for code reviews. We think how much it can produce matters. It's sticky because impressive demos look so good when they show speed of generation. And a lot of people are stuck in the mindset that that is the KPI that matters and review burden is hidden. You don't see review burden in a demo. You need to design systems that are human in the loop from the start. I've said this before. Your best humans should feel more fingertippy on your work because of AI, not not fighting AI. So AI should be able to draft useful pieces of work, whether that's code or something else. And a human should have comfortable capacity to review that work. That means being clear about what your AI scope actually is, what the scope of your AI assistant for this task actually is. And it means getting serious about how much of a review burden your AI system imposes. If you have someone and all they're doing is just hitting merge on AI generated poll requests on your codebase, you are extending vulnerability into your system because you refused to think about the review bottleneck. And there are real security implications and yes, systems really do that. Please, please, please take the time to look at whether you are architecting your system for review and for putting expert humans in touch with the work or not. Number four, the unreliable intern. Let's say AI handles 80% of a task perfectly and it fails catastrophically on the last 20%. And you can't predict when failures are going to occur. Supervision costs may approach the cost of just doing the work at that point. The root cause here is that AI lacks judgment and memory and context for what you need specifically and organizations keep trying to deploy AI on tasks that aren't AI ready yet as a result. Part of the risk here, part of why this stays sticky, is that the 80% success rate in this situation, which is like real, it feels close enough to keep trying. Teams assume just one more tweak is going to fix that issue. But the real fix is actually simple. You intentionally audit the task for intern suitability before you decide if it's AI ready. In other words, you ask yourself, would I give this to a smart but forgetful intern who can't learn? If I give them a clear task and clear context and a clear and a clear structure for the ask and output, could they do it? Break complicated tasks into subtasks. You want AI to do the retrieval and formatting. You want AI to do these sequential steps that are clear and you want humans to be able to offer that review as I said earlier. So be really explicit when you're going through this audit. I know this doesn't sound fun, but part of the ask when you do AI automation, well, when you are trying to unstick adoption blockers, it's an ask to extend organizational intent. You have to be clear about your intention for what tasks are suitable. And there is no substitute for going into the nitty-gritty and looking at those one by one. Failure number five is the handoff tax. AI can handle one step in a multi-step process. Handoffs between AI and human are not fully worked out and the system design and overall cycle time barely improves. Sometimes it gets worse. The root cause is you again you automated the wrong part of your workflow. You optimized for one bottleneck and you created two new ones on each side cuz you didn't think about your on-ramps and off-ramps. This is sticky because the per step improvement, the KPIs are going to look great. Wow, we took our per step for this drafting stage down by 200%. Well, you have to take full cycle time for workflows very seriously or you are going to discover how bad this is too late. The fix is simple and again it comes down to intent. You have to map the full intended workflow before deploying AI. Redesign it so AI can handle the on-ramps and off-ramps of all the components it needs to touch so that you are not creating new bottlenecks at the edges of AI systems. And then you want to measure cycle time for the whole process. If cycle time improvement is not moving, you probably have an issue with the edges of your AI system and how it hands off to humans. And yes, that is going to include training your humans in new patterns of work. Number six, the premature scale trap. Let's say you have a successful pilot and it's pushed rapidly to companywide. You want to double down on what's working. Edge cases will immediately multiply. Support costs are going to explode and quality is going to degrade. You, it turns out, were not ready for companywide roll out. The root cause here is that you usually have a much more controlled environment for pilots with motivated users and very clean data. This is almost a function of the purpose of the pilot. You pick these pilots because they're easier and people magically forget that when they go to roll out wide. The pilot team probably understood AI limitations and worked around them in a way the broader org doesn't and can't. This is sticky because leadership is just wired to seek a quick win on AI and they want to capture value fast and they're optimizing and it feels like testing and doing a gently scaled roll out is just unnecessary delay and not moving quickly in the age of AI. Well, I've got news. Sometimes slow is smooth and smooth is fast. The fix is honestly to document what fundamental differences exist between the pilot environment and the real environment. So document all of the workarounds that your pilot team used to achieve the results. Those become training. Document with skeptical users, not with enthusiastic ones. How do they use the tool? Research, understand, is it working? Make sure that you try a second pilot on a hard problem in the messiest part of the organization. Does that still work and deliver value? Then start to dial up in stages, right? Maybe you go to a 100 people and then 500 people before you hit 50,000. Right? You want to build support infrastructure in terms of people, learning and development opportunities, giving very very clear approval, disapproval, bug reports, lots of feedback opportunities for the software as you roll out. And then you want to monitor, right? If you get from five people or 25 people in a pilot to 500 and your support tickets are increasing per user, then you are not ready to go farther. You have found an edge case you need to resolve. take the time to do it. There's no shortcuts. Number seven, automation trap. Let's say AI speeds up existing processes. Great, but it doesn't change outcomes. Activity increases, results don't. You have you have successfully automated inefficiency. Congratulations. The root cause here is you deployed AI before asking whether the process should exist at all. You automated approval workflows that maybe shouldn't require approval. Right? There's a lot of other examples of this. This is sticky because we have the mechanical horse fallacy. That's the idea that a new technology should look like the previous one in the way that a car should look like a horse. No. I know it's easier to automate what you're already doing than to reimagine work. But the value comes from reimagining work. Before deploying, ask, should we be doing this at all? And then you want to look at outcomes that will stay steady regardless of the process behind them. Those are your north stars. So you want to look at customer satisfaction. You want to look at the efficiency with which you can do a job in a way that is steady regardless of the particular technology used. And you want to look at the perhaps business metrics that you can drive given a piece of workflow you'll automate. Whatever it is, make sure that you prototype as close as possible to a zero process version. Ask yourself, what if AI dropped this workflow? Would it work? You may not find that it does. You may find you need the workflow. N I can only take certain pieces of it. That's a great answer. But if you don't ask the question, you run the risk of a mechanical horse. You run the risk of an automation trap. And then ask yourself how you'll know when it's time to go the next step. That's sort of how people start to really build value. They look at these AI agent systems as evolving. They look at this north star of customer satisfaction or topline revenue and they say AI can't drop this process yet. It can do two parts out of six. We are going to come back in a quarter and see if we can get the whole thing because AI is getting better. Number eight, existential paralysis. Leadership is debating whether AI will cannibalize the core business and you get conflicting directives from senior leaders. You have strateg strategy discussions after strategy discussions that loop without decisions. This happens a little bit less often than some of the others because I think the FOMO and the bias for action are real in this space. But fundamentally, I have been in these rooms. I have seen people worry about the risk of AI to the point where they take no action. The root cause is that AI's pace of change is dramatically outstripping traditional corporate strategic planning cycles. And so, by the time you have built your careful 5-year AI strategy that feels steady, the landscape has shifted and it's already outdated. That has happened multiple times to organizations in the last two years. It is part of the reason why organizations are regretting building custom models back in 2022 because now they've launched them in 23 24 and now they're regretting it because the the cloud provided models are so much better. Their AI strategy stayed still because it was on a corporate planning cycle and the market shifted. Exist existential paralysis killed them. And this is sticky because outcome unpredictability makes every single decision feel really high stakes. So more analysis feels much safer than making a bold commitment. Well, the fix is simple. You can take if you're a conservative organization, if you're not ready to make a truly bold burn the boats move, which is a way that startups are addressing this and having great success. I don't want to not call that out. You can adopt a portfolio approach. If you're feeling more conservative, you can allocate your budget across different horizons, a fast payoff mode, a two to threeear bet mode, etc. And you don't have to predict which ones wins. You can diversify your bets. You can set speed targets like getting to complicated AI questions answered in Slack within 90 days and getting to truly agentic CRM automation for leads in 8 months, right? Like you can have different horizons in different bets and measure them differently. You want to also be clear in the portfolio bet world that you can have learning investments and scaling investments and that you have clear gates to get to scale. Essentially what I'm saying is if you are not a burn the boats organization, if you are a more cautious organization, which is where this happens, then you should be thinking about it as an investment in a series of equities and you don't know which one is going to be a runaway success. But, you know, failing to invest will certainly prevent you from getting a runaway success. And so, you need to balance your bets across all of the different equities you've got, watch their trajectories, and double down where they're working. And that requires a different decision-making cycle from leadership. And that is the only way I've seen that these kinds of existential paralysis organizations start to get themselves together. Finally, number nine, the training deficit and the data swamp. Two sides of the same coin. You have low adoption despite tool availability. Users revert to old workflows. Do you know why? Because AI can't access needed data and data quality issues only surfaced after you deployed the tool. The root cause here is that you deployed the tool and taught people to use the tool and never bothered to think about the data issues that the tool was surrounded by and it looked okay in training. Data infrastructure work is not fast. It doesn't ship in weeks. It's typically boring. It's expensive. It's slow. It's very difficult to fix data problems and most organizations opt to skip it if they can. This makes it sticky because training is treated as just one-time onboarding and you're not really thinking about how you build the capability to solve problems with data using AI tools for your employees. So, there's a mindset shift you have to have along with a commitment to data integrity. And so, you have to think about how you're upshifting the data to meet AI needs. and also how you're upshifting training so your team can take advantage of the AI tooling once it's connected to data. I know AI deployment is exciting and fast, but if you deploy without paying attention to the training and the data availability, you're going to be in trouble. You should allocate like I'm not kidding 3 to 6 months of expected training at enterprise scale before you start to think about ROI. You want to train on workflows, not tools. So, you want to ask, "How can I teach people to research competitive intelligence using AI?" Not, "How do you use chat GPT?" Here's a handy twoline hack for a research competitive intelligence prompt. It's a deeper conversation. You can't assume the tools will be the same over time. So, you want to focus in your training as you're starting to build people up, focus on your AI champions, focus on the ones who can teach their peers because that is going to enable you to trigger network effects that will enable AI adoption to spread faster. On the data side, you're going to need to do a full data audit. You're going to need to prioritize data access and you're going to need to assign clear data ownership so that someone is accountable for making sure data is available for the AI. What do we learn as we look across all nine of these? I'll tell you the one biggest takeaway that I have after seeing all nine of these play out in organizations over the last few months is that AI adoption remains a preventable problem. If you're having issues with your AI adoption, it's on you. Leadership is responsible for establishing the kind of intentful, thoughtful best practices that I'm describing here that keep you out of these failure modes. And when you run into them, you got to be honest. You got to say, "Here's the root cause. Here's what's making it sticky. Here's what we can do to get ourselves out of the mess." That's why I made this video.
