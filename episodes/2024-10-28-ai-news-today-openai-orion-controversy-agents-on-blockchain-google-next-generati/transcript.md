# AI News Today: OpenAI Orion controversy, agents on blockchain, Google next generation model, etc

five quick pieces of AI news from the weekend I hope you have your coffee because the first one uses the phrase homomorphic encryption and if you're wondering what is that the basic idea is you can put something into what's called CER text or encrypted strings and it retains computationally the same structure as the original uh piece of data which means you can do math on it which is important because machine learning is basically math and so the example that Apple gave was basically what if you take a picture of something and you want to find out what that something is which is a very classic thing that you ask uh open AI I I actually asked open AI what was in an image just this weekend um well let's say you ask Apple intelligence that instead let's say you're on your phone and you ask Apple intelligence what's in this image and you send the image or apple sends the image encrypted in homomorphic encryption to its servers to find out so the actual image is UN encrypted doesn't leave your phone you're you're the image is secure on your phone and the homomorphic encryption is the only thing that departs at that point Apple then does computations on it to find other homomorphically similar images what's weird is I can say things like they do math on it because it's the same shape as the data but what that means in practice is it can tell if you're looking at the Eiffel Tower so if you're looking at the Eiffel Tower and you say what is this image apple can come back because of homomorphic encryption and say that's the Eiffel Tower based on other computationally similar images in the database all of which remain encrypted it's weird it works I can't quite explain how it works either it it seems odd to me that it should work that way but homomorphic encryption is very cool we'll have to do a separate video on it okay piece of news number two a ton of discussion over the weekend on Orion Orion is the code name or the rumored code name for open ai's new model The Verge did a major report claiming that it was going to be a 100 times more powerful and it was going to debut in November which matches the rumored timeline of a lot of other Advanced models this end of year and they were saying specifically it's so powerful it's going to companies first we're not sure when it's going to be released to individuals and then immediately open AI push back still over the weekend and said no no no no no no we are not releasing a model called Orion in November now that leaves them a lot of wiggle room they could be releasing a different model they could be releasing a differently named model or they could be choosing to release it in December nobody's clarifying we don't know so stay tuned but I would still expect open AI to release something in December if only because you were seeing other releases come along and that brings me to piece of news number three which is that Google is preparing a major Gemini release in December rumor also broke over the weekend and will include the proposal or the uh enabling apis or whatever you want to put it it's very unclear it's very it's another sort of on the edge of news and rumor uh they will include an enablement for a Google AI agent driven by Gemini that's the tldr I noticed that this particular piece of news dropped after the open AI Verge article and I do wonder how much we are at this point in a news and rumor cycle where everyone wants to tell you that their that their particular model is going to be ready right at the right time and it's going to be super powerful I still think we're going to get a big model release before the end of the year I I think it will probably be somewhere in the December 1 to 15 time frame we will see okay uh the next piece of news is coinbase coinbase is also getting into the mix but they of course don't have a major llm uh model that they're going to be building on instead what they're going to be doing is just putting AI agents autonomously on the blockchain and that's been their goal uh or so they say and so they are putting out a press relas saying that's what they're doing we'll see when something actually comes out and when when they release that I just keep noticing they are releasing that after the AI meme Coin News broke over the last three or four weeks you remember I talked about the AI meme coins I talked about gosias Maximus there's been other AI mem coins this is the moment when coinbase is like ah yes we're going to do autonomous AI agents on blockchain we will see sounds like it needs some governance to me okay almost last second to last but not least uh so piece of news number five uh Nvidia is getting exported to Russia via an Indian pharmaceutical com company that seems to be a coverup called Shrea and the reason this is news is because the h100 chips which are not actually The Cutting Edge chips now they're like one generation back are not allowed to be exported to certain countries and that includes Russia and Russia is figuring out how to import them anyway apparently at scale like they've imported 1,00 or so Dell servers with h100 chips uh under cover of this pharmaceutical company in India and they're doing it uh presumably to set up their own uh AI modeling data centers we will see finally uh there was a major report on the gender gap in AI on average it found over uh multiple studies uh and I looked at the chart like it really was like 20 different studies on AI usage 25% less usage of AI by women versus men and this was not just us Tech workers in fact US tech workers if you're wondering were was the only surveyed demographic where women used AI more than men uh although it was virtually identical so that's sort of a nominal difference um but US tech workers use AI apparently two-thirds of us use AI all the time um but the gender gap is something that did persist uh across just about every other demographic that that I was looking at and I looked into the paper a little bit super interesting no one can really explain why uh and it's something that since AI usage is correlated with AI fluency it's concerning it's it's well it's concerning regardless so there you go that's the last piece of AI news I hope you enjoyed it I hope you had coffee I hope you can pronounce homomorphic encryption
