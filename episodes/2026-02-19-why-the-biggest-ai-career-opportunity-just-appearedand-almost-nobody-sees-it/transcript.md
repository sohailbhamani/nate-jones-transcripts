# Why the Biggest AI Career Opportunity Just Appeared—and Almost Nobody Sees It.

Wall Street's AI panic is out of control. On Thursday, February 12th, a karaoke company managed to crash the stock market over AI fears. This is a company called Algorithm Holdings, and they put out just a press release claiming their logistics platform could help customers scale freight volumes by 3 to 400% without adding headcounts. Within hours, CH Robinson Worldwide, one of the largest freight brokerages on the planet, plunged 24%. The Russell 3000 trucking index as a whole had its worst day since liberation day and billions in market cap evaporated across global logistics from Dallas all the way to Denmark. Algorithm Holdings has a market capitalization of $6 million. That is small for the stock market. It might be big for our bank accounts, but it's small for the stock market. It reported less than $2 million in quarterly revenue and a net loss of nearly $3 million. Until 2024, this company was called the Singing Machine Company. It sold karaoke products. So, a former karaoke company worth $6 million at best just wiped billions of dollars off an entire sector of the global economy. And the part that should concern you is not just the absurdity. It's the fact that this is now the fifth time in 10 days. Each time in a different industry, each time triggered by a different AI announcement, each time following the exact same pattern. The pattern is the story, and the pattern has consequences that go far beyond stock prices. This is the AI scare trade, and we're going to get into it. The sequence of the trade matters, so let's follow it very closely. On February 2nd, Palunteer reported quarterly earnings that obliterated expectations. 70% revenue growth, the guidance of 61% forward-looking for fiscal 2026. CEO Alex Karp claimed Palanteer's tools could compress complex SAP enterprise migrations from years of work to as little as 2 weeks. And the stock jumped 8% after hours. The market heard the subtext. If one company can do that, every company selling enterprise software on a per seat basis is repricing. So the next day, Anthropic released new co-work plugins for legal work, contract review, compliance workflows, legal summaries. I made a video about this and what happened is that within 48 hours about $285 billion in market cap vanished from SAS, legal tech and data analytic stocks. The Jeffre Equity Trading Desk gave the blood bath on the stock market a name, the SAS apocalypse. And that stuck. That was just week one. Then the contagion jumped. Private credit and alternative asset managers like Aries, KKR, TPG, Apollo, and Blackstone all fell between eight and 10% on fears that AI could analyze deals and manage portfolios. Insurance brokers got hit next after a company called Insurify released an AI rate comparison tool. The S&P 500 insurance index posted its worst session since October. Wealth management followed the day after that, triggered by Altruist, a startup most people have never heard of, launching an AI tax planning tool. Raymond James fell 8.8%. Schwab dropped 7.4%. You get the idea. Real estate services came next. CBRE and Jones Lang Lasal each fell 12%. Kushman and Wakefield dropped 14%. Worst single day decline since the COVID crash. Then office REIT started bleeding on the theory that AI would reduce headcount, which would reduce office demand, which would reduce rent. And then the karaoke company came for logistics. So in 10 days, the AI scare trade has burned through software, private credit, insurance, wealth management, real estate services, logistics, drug distribution, and commercial office space. Eight different sectors. Each sell-off was triggered by a different company in a different industry with a different product announcement. But the market's reaction was identical every time. Dump first, analyze later. Favuza, the Jeffre trader who named the SAS apocalypse the SAS apocalypse. credit to him described the broader dynamic in a note to clients on Thursday. For every corner of the market right now, there is an aggressive shoot first ask questions later for any area where there's an AI headline. He's right, but what he's describing isn't a market efficiently pricing disruption. It is something much more interesting and more dangerous. Fundamentally, Wall Street has developed an autoimmune disorder. The immune system risk repricing is attacking healthy tissue because it can no longer distinguish between what's real and what's not. And just like an autoimmune disorder, the damage caused by the immune response is now much worse than the disease it's reacting to. This is the mechanism of damage that we are all going to need to pay attention to. When CH Robinson drops 24% in a day, that isn't just a number on a screen for the 15,000 people who work there. That is a board meeting next week. That is a hiring freeze announced next month. That is the Q2 roadmap getting torn apart and rewritten around AI strategy. Whether or not the company actually has a coherent AI strategy. That is the CFO pulling forward cost cuts to demonstrate to investors that management does take this transition seriously. Stock drop doesn't just reflect reality, it creates reality. A company whose stock craters on AI fears is going to start behaving as if AI is an existential threat. Even if the actual tech is years away from threatening its core business, defensive postures get adopted right away. Innovation budgets get redirected from organic growth to performative AI partnerships. Headcount plans are going to get revised downward. Not because AI replaced anybody, but because the market priced in the expectation that it would. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said Tuesday that the sell-off was quote too broad. JP Morgan strategists see potential for a software rebound based on quote an overly bearish outlook on AI disruption. They're all probably right, but the correction, if it comes, is not going to undo the organizational decisions that were made during this panic. The hiring freeze is going to be real for many of these companies. The roadmap pivot is going to be real for many of these companies and it's going to last for quarters. The budget reallocation is going to be real. The stock market may recover in a week or two. The strategic damage this is causing to these companies is going to take months or years to start to unwind. And in the meantime, there's actual real AI disruption going on that they need to respond to on a business time scale, not a market time scale. And those are two different time scales. The market is going to demand a performative response when they should be allocating resources to a strategic business response. And this is the reflexivity that almost nobody in the financial press is talking about. The scare trade is going to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Not because AI is doing the disrupting, but because the market reaction to AI is forcing companies into this defensive crouch posture that makes them much more vulnerable to real disruption, ironically, from AI. So, the companies that respond to a 15% stock drop by gutting out their product teams and signing a splashy AI partnership are the ones that are going to get actually disrupted in 3 years, not by a karaoke company, but by a competitor that used this moment to invest in genuine AI capability and not investor optics. I want to be clear, the market is not entirely wrong, but it's hitting a fly with a hammer. It is catastrophically imprecise. The scare trade is treating every industry identically and that is the error. There are at least three distinct categories of AI exposure and the market is pricing every single one of them the exact same way which is incorrect. The mispricing here is where the real story lives for investors for founders and for all of us whose livelihood depends on any of these sectors which is increasingly well beyond tech. The first category is sectors where AI is genuinely displacing labor today. Software development is a clear example. Cursor, the AI coding editor, hit $300 million in annualized revenue, faster than almost any software product in history. It is well past 500 million now. It continues to climb. Strong DM is famously talking about paying uh a,000 bucks for tokens per developer per day and no humans doing code review. It's easy for them to come up with those numbers because they have, I think, three engineers on staff at last count or something. Meanwhile, Palunteer's own numbers uh the 61% forwardguided growth for 2026 are proof that demand for AI native enterprise software continues to accelerate. So the SAS companies whose business models depend on selling seats to humans may well be in trouble. The market is right about them. I think not necessarily about the speed. Those businesses won't vanish overnight. And not about the data. You will still need somewhere to put the data. You will still need a single ringable neck. Comparative advantage still matters. You will not want to build everything yourself. But the assumption that all of software bottlenecks on humans is incorrect. And per seat pricing is in trouble. So those companies are going to need to adapt their business models to survive. The ones that don't are going to get repriced out gradually or disrupted suddenly. That's the category most at risk. That's the category I described in my SAS apocalypse video. The second category is sectors where AI may matter on a three to fiveyear horizon, but where the current panic vastly overstates the near-term risk. Wealth management is a really great example. An AI tool that does tax planning cannot replace a wealth advisor any more than Turboax can replace accountants. The value in wealth management actually isn't doing calculating work. It's the relationship. It's the trust. It's the behavioral coaching that keeps clients from panic selling during a downturn. And yes, I'm aware of the irony of wealth management clients panic selling their wealth management stocks because of AI fears. It is almost too perfect. Insurance brokerage is a similar business. Insurifi's rate comparison tool is useful, but the actual work of a commercial insurance broker involves negotiation, claims management, industry specific risk assessment. Current AI systems are not going to immediately replicate that. These sectors are going to change with AI, but they're not going to change overnight in the next quarter. The market is pricing in a gradual transition over the next few years as if it's happening by earning season and it's going to be catastrophic no matter what. That's just wrong. And if you think that's just wrong, wait till you get to the third category. The third category is where the market has just lost the plot entirely. A former karaoke company's press release about freight optimization does not invalidate CH Robinson's relationships with a 100,000 shippers and carriers. Nor does it invalidate its proprietary data on freight lines and pricing or its ability to handle the physical, regulatory, and contractual complexity of moving goods across borders. commercial real estate services, CBRE managing billions in property transactions, they don't get automated because Claude can draft a lease summary. As Croup analyst Ariel Rosa put it about algorithm, quote, I would probably be more inclined to be skeptical that this particular company is going to be the one to disrupt the industry. I think Ariel was being very kind with that quote. But there's an important qualifier here. Eventually, disruption is going to come. The timeline the market is pricing in is delusional. the company they are choosing to react to is completely bonkers. But the idea that AI is going to have changes across every industry is not incorrect. The investment implication for all of this is pretty stark. The market is creating effectively a generational buying opportunity in some of these sectors while correctly repricing them in others. The skill is knowing which is which. And the answer is going to depend on understanding with specificity, not with panic, what AI can actually do in each vertical today versus what it may do in 5 years. Again, none of this is investment advice. I am not actively trading these companies. All I want to do is help everyone understand where AI actually is today, where AI is not, and how we can think about capital reallocation a little bit more intelligently because people's livelihoods really are on the line. When I talked about the idea that we all are affected as employees, as workers when these things happen, I'm not kidding. I have lived through situations where a market repricing has generated direct impact on headcounts, not because of business fundamentals, but because market perception is driving realities. That's wrong. We shouldn't be doing that. We should be thinking more intelligently about AI. We owe it to our businesses. We owe it to ourselves. We owe it to our employees. We owe it to our teams. So, let's dive into category one, the one that is most affected, SAS businesses. The scare trade is not just moving stock prices there. It's moving capital in ways that are going to reshape the competitive landscape for a long time to come. Let's follow the money here. Public SAS multiples are crashing. The S&P software index is down roughly 20% year-to date, and privately held AI companies continue to ascend to valuations that would have been unthinkable just a year ago. Open AAI and Anthropic and XAI collectively are well over a trillion dollars in private valuation. Anthropic raised another several hundred million $300 million I think at a $380 billion valuation just this past week. Open AAI is likely to IPO at I would guess a trillion dollar valuation later this year. That is a guess. That is not a projection. Anthropic is in early IPO discussions as well. And global venture capital continues to skew toward AI with nearly half a trillion dollars deployed in 2025. This feedback loop toward AI away from SAS is very much self-reinforcing and vicious. Public SAS valuations are cratering. Private SAS valuations are compressing in sympathy because investors just don't see the future. And it doesn't matter if you are a SAS company with a creative and innovative approach to solving the Percy problem. If you get hung with the SAS tag, which was a benefit for all of the twins, it's now an albatross around your neck. Meanwhile, AI startups, regardless of whether they're good or not, look relatively more attractive to everybody. You stick AI in the name, and magical things happen right now. Magically, more capital will flow to the AI company that has AI in the name and releases an AI press release than to anybody else. It's not fair. It's not correct. There will certainly be lots of companies that go to the wall that were overfunded who have AI in the name and released an AI press release. But capital allocation typically isn't fair. And especially when we're talking about a chance to reshape the fundamental technology landscape in a way that we haven't seen since the advent of computing. Nobody wants to miss out. That is what is driving the obsession with getting into AI and out of SAS for investors. FOMO. for founders at SAS companies who are looking to go public. The window shifted or evaporated. The IPO pipeline was supposed to finally be open wide in 2026. And I would say that expectation has shifted out a year or more at this point. Not because the companies involved are worse, but because the public market's appetite for anything that looks like a traditional software business has just evaporated at this point. If your company is perceived as AI vulnerable, which it looks like everybody is in the market's eyes right now, and even if you've deeply integrated AI into your product, you're now fighting a narrative headwind that did not exist 3 months ago. And that is going to have again real implications on real lives. Some companies will delay, some will have lower valuations. It's going to change exits for employees, some will pivot to M&A in the private markets. Wellington noted that the median time to IPO for companies valued above half a billion dollars has now stretched out to 11 years, the longest in a decade. The scare trade makes that number even worse. For AI native founders, the capital environment has never been better, but the scrutiny is way, way sharper. CLO went public with an AI powered story and is now trading near its first day closing price, which is down. The lesson is that AI powered is not a blank check long-term. Investors are interested in the AI story, but they need you to deliver on it in order to sustain capital valuations. Part of why hyperscalers continue to raise these rounds, I think anthropic was at a series G, is because they keep delivering on the revenue story. That is going to be an expectation even if you are one of the lucky ones with AI in the company name. So what does this actually mean for your career? Most of us aren't investors. Most of us are not capital allocators. Most of us are not founders. Here is where the conversation gets personal for people who work in tech or increasingly anyone who works in an industry that the scare trade has touched which is way outside tech. The most important thing to understand is that the stock price drop and the job risk are operating on different time scales but they are now feeding each other in ways that create real consequences for those of us whose jobs AI cannot yet do that are not yet vulnerable to AI. When your company's stock drops 15% on AI fears, the technology did not change at all. But the organizational response is going to. And so when every company is watching its peers get hammered in the scare trade, every company is going to be scrambling competitively to announce an AI transformation initiative that changes the market story on their company. The question you should be asking this week if you work in any of these affected sectors or frankly anywhere where the AI narrative could hit you, which if a karaoke company can crash the entire logistics market, I would say all of us need to be thinking about this because the market is being insane right now. The question you should be asking is where the AI budget for this AI transformation that your company is probably working on is coming from. Where is that money going to come from? If the money is net new investment layered on top of existing capabilities, that's a company positioning for a transition. But if the money is being taken from the product order or taken from the engineering team, the people who actually understand the business are optimizing for an investor narrative, not a product story that they can actually stand behind. One of those strategies, the first one, is going to potentially give you a shot at a competitive advantage if you execute that transition. If you incrementally invest in AI over the top of your existing capabilities, if you just start to steal money from your core technical teams, you're going to get a press release. You're going to get a headcount reduction, and you're going to have regrets. So, watch what your company is building versus what it's choosing to buy. If your company is saying, "We can buy some fancy tool and reduce headcount for PMs," you should be asking questions and polishing the resume. The scare trade is creating a really, really sharp split right now between organizations that truly understand what it takes to integrate AI into their workflows and are interested in learning what works and developing institutional knowledge about what the tech can do and what it cannot do in a very specific domain versus organizations that are in a panic that never understood AI where the CEO is reading LinkedIn posts about OpenClaw and they're just going to respond in that panic by announcing a partnership with an AI vendor and praying and hoping the stock recovers and then cutting some headcount. The latter is not a strategy. The latter is not responsible leadership and the latter is not going to lead to long-term company success. Ironically, the people responding to the AI scare trade, the leaders responding to the AI scare trade by panicking and announcing a narrative roadmap that is mostly spoken mirrors are going to be the ones most vulnerable to AI disruption later. While the builders meanwhile are going to develop a compounding advantage as they build into their current workflows and the models keep getting smarter and what they build keeps getting more useful. AI compounds for people who use it smartly. The buyers, the ones who want to just buy a tool and be done with it and have a narrative and announce a partnership, they're going to get a logo on the slide deck. But 12 months from now, the gap between the ones who are building and the ones who are just buying a vendor and praying is going to be very, very visible. Ironically, I think the people most at risk in this moment are not the ones whose jobs AI can replace today. Instead, they're the ones in any kind of cost center for companies whose stocks just dropped on AI fears. They're not going to look beyond is it a cost center. Is it in product? Is it in engineering? Is it in customer success? Anything that counts as a cost on the balance sheet. The market does not distinguish between this role will be automated and this role is at a company under AI pressure. both will get cut. Even though that's unfair, a corporate operations analyst at a logistics company that just dropped 16%. Is more immediately at risk than an identical analyst at a manufacturing company. Not because the AI threat is any different or because AI can immediately do that job, but because the stock pressure is different. The scare trade is a very, very blunt instrument, and blunt instruments create a ton of collateral damage that affects our lives. But there's a rosier side to this story. If you look carefully, there's an asymmetry here that almost no one sitting inside a panicking company is thinking about. The scare trade can be the best thing that could happen to you if you're positioned correctly as a professional in these businesses. Every company panicking about AI is about to spend heavily on AI capabilities. That spending creates roles, it creates budgets, it creates initiatives, and it creates career paths that did not exist a few months ago and that maybe would not have existed for a couple of years without this scare. So the person who spent the last year building genuine AI fluency, not just asking chat GPT to write the emails, but understanding how to integrate AI into business workflows, they're now in the position to bridge the gap between what the seuite is being told by vendors in the board and what the technology can actually do. That person, it might be you, just became the most valuable person in all of these new org charts that are being redrawn. The career move isn't learn AI. That's what we were talking about in 2024. It's very much table stakes now. And table stakes are not going to get you promoted. The career move during a scare trade like this is more specific and more urgent. Every company that just watch its sector get hammered and the ones who may be about to because I don't know that this is done. They're going to be asking the same question internally. What can AI do in our business? How can we get to workflows to data? How can we move on a timeline the board will accept? How can we get past a slide deck? Even the companies that are tempted to go with whisbang flash press releases typically do a little bit of work to try and make them real. And in almost every organization, the number of people who can answer that question with real specificity rather than just pariting vendor marketing or gesturing vaguely at the word like transformation. If the the number of people who can connect a domain, their expertise and artificial intelligence and where it's going, that number is vanishingly small at any given company. And that gap is the single largest career opportunity out there right now. Think about what happens in the next 90 days inside a company whose stock just got capped 12% on AI fears. The CEO is going to call an emergency leadership meeting. The board is going to demand an AI strategy. the chief strategy officer might put together a task force. We've all been there. We've read the headlines. They've got fear in their eyes. The person who is able to step up without fear in that world becomes indispensable. Not because of their old role, not because they're a machine learning engineer or a product manager or in revops, but because they are able to walk into a room of panicking executives and say, you know, I've been testing this. Here's what Claude can actually do with our contract review workflow. It handles about 70% of the initial analysis accurately. These are the conditional clauses it tends to miss. And this is where it cross references correctly and where it cross references incorrectly. And so we need to introduce a human check at this specific stage in the process. If we deploy it like this, we can cut our overall review time by 40%. And we can reduce outside council spend by maybe a fifth of a million dollars. And here's the implementation plan. Here's what it costs. Here's what it doesn't do. We're not going to overpromise to the board. This is a specific project we can do that has real impact on the bottom line today. That person does not exist in most organizations right now. The technical people understand the models but not the business. The business people understand the workflows but have never used the tools on a real world product and are often scared of the terminal. And so something like cloud code is scary to them. And the consultants often understand neither of them. They understand frameworks. So the gap between I've heard AI can do this and I've tested it and here's what it does for our company is a canyon and the scare trade just made crossing that canyon the most valuable thing anyone in the organization can do. The job here is domain translator. Really it won't get called that but that's what it is. And the scare trade has supercharged the demand for that role and compressed the timeline. 6 months ago, if you were the person who understood AI in your company's domain, that was a great career differentiator. You were setting yourself up well. Today, it's the difference between being on the task force and being on the layoff list. The concrete version of this looks different depending on where you sit. Obviously, if you're an ops, it means you've already taken your team's most repetitive workflow and you've run it through an AI tool, not as a demo, as an actual parallel process with real data tracking where it works and where it breaks. If you're in legal, product, HR, sales, it's the same principle. The person who has done the work of testing AI against real workflows in the real domains that they operate in. Those are the people who can articulate the results with precision. And those are the people the organization cannot afford to lose right now. The people who will get cut are the ones who cannot distinguish their work from what AI is able to do. If your contribution right now to the workforce is synthesis, reading documents, summarizing information, producing reports that aggregate other people's work, you are competing directly with a tool that does that faster and does that cheaper and the scare trade just made your CEO very aware of that. If your contribution is judgment, knowing which information matters, why the standard approach won't work for this client, what the model is missing because it doesn't understand the regulatory history or the relationship dynamics, well then you are more valuable now than you were a month ago because the organization just realized it can't automate its way to that judgment and it needs people who have it in the upcoming AI transition. Now, I'm not here to say organizations don't make mistakes. I have seen plenty of high judgment people incorrectly laid off. But the odds are better if you have that ability and if people know that you have it and it goes beyond AI. The asymmetry here is extreme. The scare trade is simultaneously destroying career value for people who were coasting on process work and creating tremendous career upside for people who can combine domain expertise with AI fluency. The gap between these two groups was growing anyway to be honest with you. But the stock market selloff made it visible to senior leadership to the seauite to the board in almost every company in America in the span of just a few days. And because of the prominence of the American stock market, there are boards all over the world looking at this. Now visibility like this is what turns a slow trend into an urgent capital reallocation in favor of AI. I'm not kidding when I say the AI scare trade is speeding up AI transformation by years at tens of thousands of businesses. The scare trade is a transfer of career capital from the people who treated AI as somebody else's problem to the people who have been invested in understanding it. The stock drops are just the visible part of that. The org chart reshuffleling is the part that determines your next 5 years. Look, AI disruption is real. It's not evenly distributed and the market's current method of pricing it, which is really a sectorwide panic triggered by press releases from companies with $6 million market caps. It's creating a mispricing so severe that it constitutes at the same time a historic investment opportunity and a historic reallocation of organizational attention. The companies that are going to lose in this new world are the ones that mistake the market's panic for a strategic signal and don't think carefully. The ones that choose to respond by gutting their teams and signing performative partnerships and praying that the stock recovers are going to be in trouble. The companies that win are going to be the ones that use the panic as cover to invest in genuine AI capability in the domain expertise that makes AI useful rather than generic. in the people who understand both the tech and the business well enough to know where real leverage lies. The scare trade is repricing the future. We can't do anything about that. The question is whether you're going to let the market's fear redefine your strategy or whether you're going to build the thing that the market will reward long term. The disruption is real. The timeline is completely bonkers right now. And the opportunity that that creates is unprecedented. And somehow an AI karaoke company helped to kick off all of it.
