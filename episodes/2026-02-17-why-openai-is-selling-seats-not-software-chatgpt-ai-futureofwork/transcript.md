# Why OpenAI is selling seats, not software #chatgpt #ai #futureofwork

to understand OpenAI's 2026 strategy. It helps to stop thinking in terms of the product as a singular entity and start thinking in terms of seats because effectively I think the right analogy is that open AI is running an airline with scarce inventory. In this case it's like you have an airline that's running a popular route from New York to London and you just cannot get enough seats on that airplane. In this case, the compute is the scarcity and they have to allocate seats on that jet between the consumer who's not willing to pay a whole lot by and large where defaults have to be cheap, where they have to be fast, and the enterprise seat where outcomes and governance are demanded. You have a lot of standards here. And then there's the investor and capital seat on the plane where the only real question is, do you have enough cash runway and deals in place on compute to keep the machine flying until you get to cash flow positivity, until you get to profitability?
