# AI News: AWS $4B Anthropic Deal, Windsurf vs Cursor—The Battle of Agentic LLM Coding Applications

three pieces of AI news to get your week started number one comes from the world of llm driven coding we have now seen enough development in this space that I think we can reliably classify the llm driven coding applications into two categories category one is for people who are just getting started en coding and who probably are depending on the llm to help them figure out what to do next bolt fits in there uh lovable fits in there repet fits in there these are all browser-based applications number two is an actual development environment that you download and install on your local machine and use an llm inside the development environment in order to help you code faster and that's for people generally who know a little bit more about coding cursor is a great example there another great example is winds Surf and that's my piece of news so winds surf fundamentally has shifted these Stakes for llm driven coding by making it more agen toied they call this Cascade I played with it just yesterday and I'm able to put up a reasonable looking landing page in 10 minutes and part of how it does that is by being more proactive than most llm driven coding applications have been but that's not it that brings me to my second piece of news so cursor is worried about the market share and the chatter that wind surf has been able to Garner in the last couple of weeks and they were clearly worried enough about it that I think they rushed their release of their new agents and so cursor now has an agent-based flow that people are comparing to like a software intern where you can just tell it to do something and you can go off and you can enjoy a movie and come back and see what cursor has built to me like looking at it it looks a lot like cursor shipped something very quickly in order to stop the chatter around wind Surf and this continues to underline the arms race Dynamics amongst key players in the llm ecosystem so for large language models if you don't have attention you don't have anything you don't have oxygen you don't have momentum you don't have a chance to raise and so when you get into a position where you are neck and neck with another player and that player makes a strategic move you have got to make that same move relatively quickly or you lose perceived momentum and that can in turn translated into lost users lost Revenue Etc and so when winds surf shipped curser was put in a position where they had to ship agents very quickly in order to catch up now I will tell you to be honest I've played with both both wind Surf and cursor and I still think wind surf is sort of the best environment out there for right now I feel like it's the most flexible it's the the most proactive it's the most thoughtful and I and I know that's an odd thing to say about an llm but it does give me the impression that it's really being thoughtful across the code base and that's something that others have noticed as well okay so those are the first two pieces of news wind surf dropping which I know is not like super recent but I wanted to contextualize it within the sort of larger arms race and then cursor shipping agents which did happened very recently it was just over the weekend okay third piece of news is AWS funding anthropic for $4 billion now the money itself is not such a big deal certainly open AI has raked in vast amounts and this is just a drop in the bucket by comparison what's interesting from a strategic perspective is that this ties anthropic more deeply into Amazon's larger strategic agenda and it also gives us a chance to look at the partners that they are serving with this new AWS anthropic collaboration so we get some names all right first from the chips up fundamentally Amazon is not happy with the amount of money they are shoveling to Jensen hang and Nvidia right now and they have to in order to run their large language model driven cloud services so AWS Bedrock for example they would like it to be not on Nvidia chips and right now they are too dependent so they have spun up a project called onap porna which is designed to give them new Chips it's the uh trinium initiative I believe where it's focused really on sort of chips that enable you to train llms efficiently and critically part of the deal with anthropic is anthropic working with the Anapa team on the tranium chips so that the tranium chips become the preferred way to train clawed models that was part of the the deal that was struck and when you think about it that is a pretty significant commitment on anthropics part because it means that if Nvidia were to make a really significant innovation in chip production which historically they have well anthropic might have less flexibility than open Ai and Google to take advantage of that they're sort of locked in now the exact terms haven't been disclosed but they seem to be de facto locked in to to the AWS plans to displace Sid's chips and that's a fairly big betat for anthropic to make at the same time I think AWS has more flexibility yes anthropic is the preferred partner I'm sure there's paper to that effect but Amazon is just so much bigger than anthropic that if they needed to shift to having a different preferred partner because open AI hit artificial general intelligence first there will be a way for them to get out of that paper and do that that so I think that Amazon retains more strategic flexibility than anthropic in this relationship but anthropic had limited options to raise after open AI sucked a lot of the oxygen out I don't know if you noticed but at the end of the day after the open AI raise that was huge a couple of months back nobody's really raised in the major model maker space and so anthropic actually getting enough dollars on the table to keep rolling and keep training and getting a strategic partner for training there's probably credit for training and other kinds of things that are off the table in terms of cash they needed it they had to take the deal so that's my analysis of the AWS uh anthropic deal I think it's an important one I think it's something that's going to keep Claud in a position to continue competing with open AI which is good for the industry and good for all of us and I think finally it's interesting to see how far they've been able to come so we actually got to see some of their partners and that was in the press release because it often is uh and and it's really interesting they talked about partnering with Intuit they talked about partnering with uh fizer on drugs which I don't know what it is but like every single model maker is really into bragging about their Partnerships with big Pharma and then finally they talked about the European Parliament which I thought was really interesting because if you're working with a European Parliament it means you see a pathway to having your models be compliant and first class citizens in the EU which would be a big get because I know that that the EU has been somewhat more cautious about how to Greenlight these models versus the us there you go those are the three big pieces of news we have the whole cursor wind surf Dynamic we have the Strategic analysis of AWS and of anthropic and of course cursor dropping that agent just to try and get a leg up on wind surf you tell me do you think wind surf is better or do you think cursor is better cheers
