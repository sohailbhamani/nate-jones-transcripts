# DOJ wants to break up Google: Here's the strategy

so last week the Department of Justice won its case against Google when a federal judge ruled that Google is a monopoly and that matters because it paves the way for the Department of Justice to propose remedial action to benefit consumers after the ruling it is rare in the United States for a antitrust challenge that alleges a monopoly to win in fact the biggest example I can think of happened over two de ades ago when Microsoft faced a breakup proposal from the Department of Justice over a similar kind of ruling under antitrust legislation and I want to walk through that Microsoft example because I think it holds some lessons for us as we think about how large companies Faire under the US legal system in Tech so in in the Microsoft example essentially it was Windows that was the play Windows and the software that was bundled with it was considered monopolistic uh and the doj proposed breaking it up so what happened at the time was that the uh judge judge Penfield Penfield Jackson ordered that Microsoft be split into two separate entities one for operating systems and one for software Microsoft of course immediately appealed the decision and the appeals court in 2001 overturned the ruling in part citing concern concerns about the judge's conduct and statements during the trial at the end of the day what matters here is that even if you get to a point that is farther than what we're at now with Google this all can come to nothing so in that situation judge Penfield said yes to breaking up Microsoft as a remedy and Microsoft appealed and still got it overturned and instead said they pursued a settlement agreement and part of why that worked is that the political climate and aspect uh of the doj changed after the election in 2000 and an Administration came in that was much friendlier to large businesses and much less inclined to pursue the initial ruling and so Microsoft worked with the Bush Administration at the time to settle and it wasn't a no teeth settlement effectively it required Microsoft to change some of their business practices they had to share apis with thirdparty companies um and there were other measures that were taken to reduce the Monopoly power that was identified in the Judgment but long story short the pace at which the legal system moves to address these things and the caution that the legal system exercises before employing a drastic solution like a breakup implies strongly that even though the doj won their antitrust case it's still a long long way to go before anything as drastic as a breakup would occur and I think that's reflected in the way stock prices have behaved since the announcement yesterday they've shifted they've shifted down a little bit it hasn't been a dramatic response because largely the market has priced in the doj will continue to take action here but it's unlikely to be a full breakup that would affect the profit and loss statement of the business as a whole when you think about sort of how to address this from a doj perspective I do want to call out that part of why it's hard in the United States to address monopolies like this is because under our legal standards we have to meet a very high bar to change corporate structure so we have to meet a consumer welfare standard we have to evaluate whether or not the change would harm consumers there's a reasonable case to be made that breaking out Android and chrome could harm consumers and I'm sure Google will be making that case there is a case to be made for remedial proportionality which is a fancy way of saying is breaking up Google the correct response even to a monopolistic ruling or is the correct response that's more proportional to make them change their business practices another factor is understanding the market power that Google has in detail and understanding what is needed so that other legitimate competitors can compete in the space without Google exercising Market power to presumably block them and that's a really sticky one because in a sense you're sort of anticipating hypotheticals and it's difficult to do that effectively when you're making a ruling like this I want to call out just a couple of other I think that in general the doj proposing a structural remedy like this as opposed to a behavioral remedy so the structural remedy is the breakup the behavioral remedy is something like change your business practices for Microsoft it was hey add some apis the structural remedy is the more extreme one the fact that they floated it from a game theory perspective suggests to me very strongly that that was one an intentional leak and two a leak that was designed to remind Google that doj can make their lives quite difficult after this ruling and to make Google more amable to a behavioral remedy solution that doj is actually contemplating so I see this as a move that doj is making in the ongoing chess match with Google as opposed to an actual working proposition I'm curious what you think though do you think that doj's proposal to break up Google is the real deal or do you think this is just all something that's going to blow over
