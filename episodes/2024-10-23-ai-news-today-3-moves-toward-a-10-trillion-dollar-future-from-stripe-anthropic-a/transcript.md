# AI News Today: 3 moves toward a 10 trillion dollar future from Stripe, Anthropic, and Perplexity

I want to take two or three pieces of news that all broken the last 24 hours in the tech space in Ai and I want to put them together in the context of a larger frame around where AI is going so the frame here is the Sequoia paper that came out that talks about the fact that we're moving into a world where we're no longer looking just at the pure software Market which could be valued at maybe half a trillion dollars but we're actually looking at A1 trillion do software and services Market as addressable if we factor in AI because AI is so effective at services so basically if you look at like where do people get the money back on these Investments it's their them thinking they have this pie that's grown much much larger and it's now a 10 trillion dollar pie to play with rather than a half a trillion dollar piie to play with all of these are very large numbers but when you're looking at investing as much as people are investing in AI the larger number does matter because you do have to get that Roi back okay with that context in that frame what developments matter over the last couple of days number one you will be surprised by this but number one is a boring business so so to speak that is not necessarily directly AI related but will tie into AI over the next 12 months that is Stripes acquisition of bridge so stripe bought bridge for a rumored $1.1 billion and stripe of course is in the payment space bridge is also in the payment space but it's in crypto and it's in stable coins and providing apis for stable coins specifically the reason why this is interesting is because this is a classic example of what I would call a stripe type acquisition where it makes a lot of financial sense there's a very hard use case in Roi and that's not typical for crypto and it's really interesting to be in a world where if you're looking at the range of news crypto is the thing with the stable use case the boring business case and it's the AI stuff that's more speculative and in this situation what stripe is looking to do is essentially to undercut the power that the card monopolies have so Visa Mastercard they're charging stripe for handling payments and it is non-trivial at strip's volume stripe handles over a trillion dollars in transactions every year and so if you're paying 1 to 3% on that that really adds up and so what bridge does is it provides you the option to start to move some of that payment volume to stable coins which in turn gives you a frictionless payment method that unlocks a lot of really interesting use cases yes including potentially AI use cases so for example the underlying unit economics of card volume make it hard to do micro payments and one of the real challenges on the web is that we have sort of a lower limit around $5 where it doesn't make sense to charge less than that except in really extraordinary circumstances and that's why games will often charge you in smaller increments but not really charge your wallet and they you'll just recharge your wallet periodically and so we don't really have a good you know answer for micro payments Bridge or something like Bridge is a way to handle that because it could be potentially really frictionless to do micro payments another example uh just fundamentally is that you could do something like a wallet experience where you move your currency into stable coins with stripe you could pay on stripe as much as you want with zero transaction fees and stripe could pass those savings to you and stripe could then know you had the cash because like it's in the wallet in the account and the entire system would be sort of a closed loop with stripe driving it so there's there's like more margin for stripe to capture there there's savings to pass on to Merchants savings to pass on to customers Al Ely that was the really hard-headed use case for bridge uh I noticed they have API documents Etc and that's very strip like I'm really curious to see where this goes because stripe has definitely been very hard-headed when it comes to how they handle payments and so if they're buying this they clearly see a use case that they're going to go somewhere with that's the boring news here's the the more speculative news and how this relates to this larger 10 trillion doll software frame so we have two examples of agentic reasoning and agentic search and agentic use cases for AI and just to remind you like agentic means like essentially the AI is driving the computer for you the AI will do a task independently and come back and you don't have to tell it what to do every single time right you don't have to give it micro tasks and micro micro work along the way to accomplish a larger task release one is anthropic actually releasing a larger SEO search agent experience and by larger I don't mean that it's like bigger on the screen I mean that it's more in-depth I mean that you can give the agent more to do and that is not coincidentally tied to the release of Claude 3.5 which is the other major release that I'm going to talk about so Claud 3.5 is specifically trained on agentic use cases and they actually released that as a bench and they talked about how much better the new 3.5 Sonet is than the existing one at agentic use cases and when you think about it what Claud is trying to do from a sort of strategic perspective is unlock agentic use cases for developers and so what they highlighted was you know Reet using uh the new claw agent for computer use to do uat Etc but what people's imagination got caught by it wasn't necessarily developers it was actually consumer use cases that I saw I saw someone order lunch with their Claude agent just yesterday now it was hard because Claude doesn't really want you to do that they don't want the agent making purchases there's obviously big liabilities there imagine the agent racking up thousands at like a luxury store without your consent Etc it could be a real problem but the idea of an agent that drives your screen and uses your screen as an API to see the world that's something that has consumer implications as well now this is very token heavy so like it's like 2 billion and change tokens for 15 20 minutes of of screen time you do have to bail it out it get stuck in a ditch a lot I joked yesterday about how distractable it is it is definitely distractable um but the point is like this is one of those situations where if you walk back to stripe and Bridge stripe and Bridge like the crypto use case it's actually very hard-headed in strip's case whereas with anthropic it's clearly in experimental mode they said it's in experimental mode it is a technology looking for use cases and we have guesses at what those use cases would be but we're going to have to discover them and perplexity is taking that same underlying technology and working it into the perplexity search and actually making it useful for extended search query so it can independent the agent independently sefs the web for you and answers your query and it's already wrapped into perplexity Pro so if you're perplexity Pro user you already have it and what I find interesting is is that in this situation the technology is finding use cases within existing pieces of AI software faster because they're more narrowly defined and so perplexity just has to handle search they don't have to handle a mouse moving around your screen they don't have to handle keyboard inputs it's just a search agent and that limitation that like lockdown of what the scope of the agent can do makes it more useful and I am wondering as we look back at this like a 10 trillion play if essentially what we're going to see is three different kinds of plays we're going to see infr plays where you have folks like stripe or bridge that are innovating on infrastructure to enable the kind of underlying payments software infrastructure that you need to have an AI economy and I think the bridge fits into that like you will need micro payments to make AI work well because you have a lot of micro interactions and then on top of that you're going to have very defined and narrow use case Innovation and that's really the perplexity space like we do search that is what we do and I think that is also coming soon because I think you have immediate applications for that core Innovation and then at the very end of the of the value chain you have this sort of core speculative Innovation that's coming from the core big four or five language model shops and anthropic is one of them and when they do things like release a general purpose computer user experiment it's going to be a bit before we figure out exactly how to use that I think it's coming I think it's probably coming sometime we we'll see some usefulness uh and some scaled application for it sometime next year in 2025 it is not something that I would say is close to ready for prime time today in October 2024 and I realize that saying that over a period of months makes me seem crazy because this is all moving so fast and like you fast forward 6 months and normally you're you're used to seeing like gradual progress because that's what we've had it will feel much faster than that but still it is very speculative today it is very speculative today so if I wrap all of that back to the AOA frame and kind of where we started out ultimately what will capture the services Market that 10 trillion Doll Market that SEO is painting a picture of is specific use cases that enable people to solve their problems dramatically faster I actually think perplexity is positioned really well here I think stripe is positioned well just to capture underlying uh margin from payments volume they're just moving into into a place where they can solidify that position and solidify their scale over time that's what the bridge acquisition was about um and ultimately anthropic is positioned as a utility anthropic is positioned as a utility that that enables that scale by charging per token and so really the key underlying factor for them to get more adoption of some of these Technologies is to bring down the cost per token which is exactly what we've seen them doing I know this has been in-depth at length and it's been a little bit of a strategic frame but I like to step back and put the news in that perspective sometimes because I think it's really important so we don't lose our way hope you enjoyed it cheers
