# AI News: Mistral is back, DeepSeek owns AI.com, Sam's 3 Laws of AI

all right so much happened over the weekend let me see if I can get through it first you may not notice this but mistol has launched again now mistro was out with models earlier they were a French AI model maker they are back with a consumer app and it is blazing fast like I played with it it's free to play with you don't even need an account the thing is like I blank fast apparently it runs on Swiss silicon they're building some sort of French Data Center to House it they're clearly trying to make the case that European model makers are not done so we will see uh when I played with it it felt to me like about a four class model GPT 40 um and it it felt really fast it's the fastest model I've played with so if you're looking for blazing speed trimestral next uh chat GPT became the sixth most visited website in the world and that's before their Super Bowl ad uh and if you wonder you know how much of the internet's traffic is number six worth and previously I'd heard they were at number eight how much is number six worth it's 2.3% 2.3% of the internet's traffic for number six well what's number one oh it's google.com uh 29.2% or so uh so more the the reward for being number one is more than 10 times number six that's how big a deal it is and uh as Sam put it himself in a little tweet we have a long way to go to rund down Google so you know he's coming for Google this brings me to the Super Bowl ad that Chad GPT ran there were a number of other AI ads Gemini I thought speaking of Google did a great job explaining how AI can actually help they've had I guess a year or so to think about it and I thought the ads that they showed actually showed people using AI in ways that made sense so that was helpful um but Chad GPT did not they actually made and I can't believe they did this they it was a branding play I suspected it would be a branding play but they made the symbol of waiting on their app the center of their brand which I thought was a very curious choice for an ad to the general public like you know how Chad GPT does the little three dots and dances like that was the heart of the Ed it was a DOT that kind of exploded into patterns and visuals and became a sailing ship and then a rocket and then Chad GPT um and this was on the same weekend that mistol dropped and incredibly fast model with no waiting and I I'm not a Brandon guy maybe they're right maybe that maybe it was the right call because everyone knows the dots maybe the dot will stick around because it's the same dot for voice mode right I'm not sure but it felt like an odd choice to me especially not to you Sora like there was no Sora at all involved in any of that next uh a little bit of trivia or maybe you didn't know this Google used to own ai.com uh but deep seek definitely now owns it it redirects to deep seek.com so either Google's playing games or deep seek owns ai.com which I think is interesting finally uh Sam spent the Super Bowl or the morning of the Super Bowl writing a blog post with what I would describe as sam's three laws of artificial intelligence not to be confused with Asim Mo's Three Laws not to be confused with Moore's Law governing compute uh Sam's laws are about intelligence and Sam first talks about the cost of intelligence he says the cost of a given level of artificial intelligence declines roughly 10x every year this is in line with observed values it's part of why it's not that surprising that deep seek claimed a relatively affordable training cost even though that was not fully loaded but what that means if you think about it if it goes down 10x every 12 months in 3 years it's a thousand times less than what it was originally like it just goes to zero so fast well you wonder is there value and Sam's Third Law not the second suggest there Sam basically says there's super exponential uh value in intelligence and he just sort of asserts that I think think right now everyone who's putting money on the table would agree with him but that value statement is why he can afford to spend so much and why he believes staying only a few months ahead of folks like deep seek is enough and that brings me to the second law so we did the first law which is declining cost we did the third law which is wow this is really valuable and then we did the Second Law Second Law is the essentially says that intelligence is the log of resources invested and so as as just to like make the logarithmic relationship very blunt if you put 10x the resources in you get 2x the intelligence and this this is why Jensen hang sleeps well at night uh you you have to invest an immense amount more in chips and data centers and training and inference and order to get more intelligence out you just do and Sam says that's something that holds true across a wide range of scales I I have observed so far that that is true and I'm sure he's right about it um and if that's true it means that they are going to keep investing enormous amounts in scaling up intelligence so there you go those are Sam's 3 laws uh that's what happened over the weekend so much happened mistol is back uh if you were an Eagles fan you had a great weekend and you're probably not watching this at all uh either way way I hope you have a great week cheers
