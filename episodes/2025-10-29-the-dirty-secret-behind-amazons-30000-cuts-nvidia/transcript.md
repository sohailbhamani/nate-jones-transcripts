# The Dirty Secret Behind Amazon's 30,000 Cuts: Nvidia

Amazon laid off 30,000 people this week in a move that had been widely telegraphed for months. But the real story is not about AI and jobs. The story I'm seeing over and over and over again in the news media is, hey, AI is automating all of these jobs. This is why we're seeing this. We're going to see more of these cuts. The media seems really excited about that story and they just want to keep telling it. And I got to say it keeps not being in this case. There's a very interesting reason why it's incorrect. And I think it's actually really important for us to understand because it gets at a core narrative that a lot of people have about AI that is wrong. So what actually happened here? Number one, you need to understand where Amazon's business came from. I spent half a decade at Amazon. I'm very fluent in this. Amazon makes their money on AWS, not on retail. The whole store doesn't do anything, right? that the margins on the store are ridiculously low. They make no money. They would not be a profitable company. Jeff Bezos would not be wandering around in a yacht. Amazon makes their money on AWS, which means the entire street, all of Wall Street checks AWS's growth numbers every single year obsessively to tell whether or not Amazon is doing well. And the problem is that AWS's growth numbers have been declining for the last few years. And so they're down to 18% growth year-over-year, which is a deceleration in their last quarterly report. And the street doesn't like it. And part of the reason the street doesn't like it is that in the meantime, AWS's two main rivals, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, have been catching up and they have been doing so with AI. Right? If you think about where to go for AI, you think about Azure and you think about Google Cloud. And I got to be honest, AWS is a distant third. They just aren't there. And so the challenge for AWS is they need to show that they are still serious players in the AI era. To do that, what do you need? You need a specific piece of hardware that Jensen Fuang sells that nobody else has. It's the Nvidia GPU. I well there's a few others that have GPUs but by and large it's all Jensen's GPUs and you got to buy a bunch of them and they don't come cheap like think of this as a computer chip that is worth a car and you have to buy thousands and thousands and tens and thousands of them to get anywhere with AI especially at scale especially if you're serving corporations that is the dilemma that AWS faces now look at it from a corporate finance perspective you have to do that without damaging your margins in AWS because the whole reason Amazon is worth anything as a company is because of AWS's margin. So you don't dare damage AWS's margins to get this job done, but you have to buy a whole bunch of GPUs. In finance terms, you have to add a ton to your capital expenditures, your capex. Well, if you're going to do that and you want to keep your margins consistent, you have to cut other places that are in your expenses category. You have to look at other fixed expenses. And what is the biggest fixed expense category that you have? It is salaries. It's salaries. That is what they're looking at. And so when you have that tradeoff, what you should really be looking at is Amazon did not fire 30,000 people because AI automation was already taking their jobs. Amazon fired 30,000 people because they needed the money today in order to buy GPUs to desperately try to secure a place in the future of AI cloud. That is the actual story. Now, that story does not sound as nice for Amazon as a future forward story about how we're automating with AI. So, the story Amazon's putting out is, hey, we're automating with AI, so we don't need these jobs anymore. No. Especially as someone who worked there, the interior workflows at Amazon, and anyone will tell you this, this is not proprietary. It's all duct tape and bailing wire in there. Like, everyone does a lot of manual stuff. And that's been very intentional as Amazon has grown because it helps us keep costs low for customers. And so, there is not a huge massive automation magical solution that they have invented that allows them to right now cut 30,000 jobs. It just that's not how it works. The people who remain are very stressed. They may have ambitious projects to eventually bring AI into those areas. But if I'm looking at it at a very high level, what I see is not an investment roadmap for AI automation that is already paid off that they're trying to show. No, what I see is Amazon saying these are areas where we can afford to take a risk on less talent getting less done. In other words, these are areas that we can divest a little bit. And that's interesting because that makes a whole lot of sense when you look at where some of these cuts happened. As an example, MGM got hit, the Hollywood studio that Amazon bought a few years ago. I got to say, if you're asking yourself, is this an area where we have already invested our best efforts to automate AI right away? MGM would not be at the top of my list. I do not think that is the most strategic place in Amazon where Amazon would have poured vast resources to invest in AI. No. But I do think it makes a ton of sense as a place where Amazon would say we can invest less for a little bit and cut talent for a bit because we desperately need to reallocate cash over to the GPU side of the business. Well, that makes a lot of sense, doesn't it? And people aren't reporting that. And here's the reason why all of this matters. The narrative out there is very simple. We are in a bubble. Everywhere I look, we are in a bubble. AI is a bubble. AI is a bubble. But step back, take a breath, don't just obsess over the news. If we are in a bubble, why does Amazon have a 25% essentially overage rate? Right? The the the amount of demand they have for for GPUs right now vastly exceeds the available GPUs. Would that be true if we were in a bubble? Demand is a sign that we are not in a bubble. surging corporate demand that Azure has trouble meeting because Azure's expanded their data center investments this year that Google Cloud has trouble meeting that Amazon has tons of trouble meeting is a sign that we have built something with AI that is valuable enough that corporations are lining up like crazy to buy it. If you have customers out the door and cannot serve enough chips to all of them, that is a sign that you are not in a bubble. Ipso facto. By definition, it is a sign that you are not in a bubble. And I don't understand why this is so hard for people. I don't understand why journalists are so interested in pedalling the narrative that AI has already automated jobs and that somehow we are simultaneously in a bubble because both of those things cannot be true at once. If we lived in a world where AI had magically automated away all jobs or whatever they're claiming, well then it wouldn't be a bubble because people would like corporations would have demand for that, right? They they would ask for that to happen so they could expand their footprint. maybe not even to fire people but to add more like c talent and capability right there'd be demand for it if we were you know in a bubble we would not have the kind of surging interest in AI at every level small medium business uh commercial scale enterprise scale the consumer like all of us as individuals that's not the story we see and yet we are being asked to believe by the media simultaneously that AI is so big and scary it is automating jobs and also though that somehow we are magically in a bubble and it's all fake. It's it's not both people. It's not both. And in this case, it's not either one of them because we don't have the talent yet to build AI systems that fully automate roles and we like not for a while. Like it's not there. And yet corporations love that narrative because it makes them future focused. It makes Wall Street happy because Wall Street doesn't know what AI is. And everybody like goes away happy with the story. And nobody pays attention to the contradictions here. The the answer is very simple. They just need to buy GPUs because corporations need to buy cloud compute. And that is what happened. And none of that makes getting fired easier. I don't want to sort of pretend that being able to explain it makes it better. It it sucks to be fired. I've been fired before. It just it's terrible. And so for those of you who have unwillingly left Amazon, there are Amazon alumni. We're out here. We look out for each other. We're doing our best. And you will find a spot. And I know that none of this makes it better. But I do hope that we actually can tell the truth about what is going on instead of getting fooled by stories that are not even not even coherent, right? Like you can't have both an AI bubble and AI automating all jobs. It does not work. And yet that is the story we're being sold. So there you go. That's the truth. That's why it matters. And that's why we need to pay attention when people make layoff announcements like that. Good luck. Don't conf.
