# Long Take: Foundational Concepts in Artificial Intelligence

hello today we're going to talk about foundational Concepts in artificial intelligence and I'm aiming this presentation at people who perhaps haven't had technical Concepts in artificial intelligence explain to them but they work with AI every day so if that's you if you work in Tech if you're in marketing if you're in customer success sales product management this presentation is for you even if you're in leadership and you want to understand what is AI so let's dive right into it here's what we're going to cover today number one we're going to talk about the foundational Tech that enables AI so things like neural Nets Transformers attention ETC number two we're going to use that knowledge of foundational Tech to understand how machines learn so fine-tuning context Windows all of that number three we're going to talk about the emergent behaviors that happen once these machines start to actually operate in the real world these are things that get us excited and or frightened so Hallucination is one example that we'll cover and finally we'll talk about the social impact of AI what can we see here in 2024 that shapes the way we understand how llms could influence our careers how they're influencing our companies how they're influencing The World At Large all right let's get into it foundational Tech what is inside that magic box and no it's not a ghost it just sometimes feels like it all right we're going to we're going to start with neural Nets neural Nets are fundamentally machines that we've built that develop pattern recognition by mimicking neurons they're artificial neurons that learn from experience so like neurons they use networks to spot patterns learning happens when they tweak connections which is what happens in our own brains and that simple mathematics that tweaks connections actually yields emergent understanding if you want to get technical about it multi-layered networks of artificial neurons process input data and they adjust connection strengths through something called back propagation to minimize error now back propagation isn't is that simple mathematics we talked about is where you you just have very simple adjustments to the connection strength and that minimizes error and it improves pattern recognition over time as neuron Nets are trained on large amounts of data now this foundational concept underlies everything else that we're going to talk about especially trans for our architecture another key concept I want to talk about is tokenization tokenization is this idea of a vocabulary of small units that helps the machine read relationships at a larger range of scales so tokenization actually chops text into little legol likee building blocks it helps machines recognize patterns and Tents and other parts of the word suffixes prefixes and it balances in between letters and whole words if you want the technical explanation algorithms segment text into discrete units or tokens like words or subwords or even characters which are then converted into numerical representations so that the model can process them tokenization is a prerequisite for everything in text based Ai and it directly impacts things like context window size which we'll talk about later in this presentation so Transformers we talked about this earlier when we mentioned neural Nets fundamentally Transformers enable machines to consider an entire block of text at once that means the machine reads the entire sentence it doesn't just discover the text word by word that helps it figure out relationships between words and juggle those relationships as far as I know jet GP jet GPD is not autonomously Contender although I hear there's a lot of AI enabled dating right now the technical description here is that Transformers utilize self attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different parts of input simultaneously as they pull the whole text in and that enables them to process in parallel across that relationship set and to capture very long range dependencies and so part of why this text processing is important is if you have a good siiz context window which will get to you can then understand how parts of the text that are somewhat separated actually relate together humans can read a text and say oh well this is how the introduction led to the conclusion that kind of thing is something that Transformer architecture enables machines to do as well this is key to the performance that modern language models have been able to unlock and relies heavily on this idea of self attention which is what we want to get to next here an llm can dynamically focus on different parts of the conversation independently that means it can listen for connections it remembers context versus current words and it can shift Focus as your conversation with the llm evolves so technically speaking that means it's Computing attention scores between all pairs of input elements creating a weighted sum that emphasizes the relevant connections and the textual information now part of how it does that on the Fly is based on previous training where it's done this it's looked at test texts before it's looked at a lot of training Data before and it's computed a lot of these scores in the past so that it understands this is how this kind of text typically works these are the relationships that typically apply and that allows it to you know behave as if it's seen resumés before when you input your resume all right this mechanism is the crucial underlying factor for Transformer architecture in fact there's a very famous paper in AI called attention is everything and it's all about why this unlocks so many capabilities in llms it contributes to the model's ability to understand and the entire piece of context that the chat is giving it we'll get into chats and context windows in a little bit all right so those are some foundational Concepts when we understand those how do those help us understand how models learn and how they adapt for different applications general knowledge is too General most of the time is one of the things I want you to take away here because we have these huge models that are very general but a lot of the work being done in AI is basically taking those foundational models that are trained on so much data most of what Humanity has created created today and and focus on taking them to a particular application and tuning them we'll describe how that works so the first concept to understand when you're talking about this is transfer learning so if you want to talk about how machines learning fund how machines learn fundamentally pre-training on lots of General data enables rapid learning of specialized subjects so what that means is that AI is using Knowledge from one task for other tasks because it has that foundational knowledge set it initially needs a massive amount of data and when I say everything that Humanity has written to date I really do mean that it's everything they can find on the internet it's digitization of every book they can get a hold of it's a massive amount of data this enables it to understand fundamentally how human language works there is a lot of suspicion that llms have figured out intuitively a grammatical structure that linguists can't yet formally describe which is a nice little tidbit for a cocktail party sometime uh when it's learning it preserves learned patterns as it looks at new data and those patterns are driving really quick learning when it grasps new subjects so it looks at things in the light of what it's learned before if you want to get technical about it pre-trained models on large data sets are fine-tuned on smaller and task specific data sets and that allows the transfer of learned features and knowledge across those domains efficiently this is closely related to fine-tuning which we're going to get into all right fine-tuning is when you are adjusting parameters or weights from your general learning data set to more effectively fit a task specific data set so you start with base parameters from general knowledge you look at examples of a specific task and you optimize those weights I think of this as tweaking a recipe so technically speaking a model adjusts pre- trained model parameters using task specific data often with a lower learning r rate so it's not perhaps quite as efficient because it's a smaller amount of data but it adapts the model's knowledge to a particular domain so you get that efficiency back because there's all of this background knowledge which is what we talked about earlier fine-tuning is one practical application of this idea of transfer learning and can help mitigate hallucination and we'll get into talking about hallucination so again from from a super non-technical perspective this is taking your French omelet recipe and it's adjusting it just a little bit if you want to bring in the summer herbs from the garden that's the idea of fine tuning you're fine tuning especially if you're fine tuning for an audience like you're bringing someone over for brunch well you want to optimize your omlets okay next concept is context windows so fundamentally llms can only ingest a certain number of tokens per turn there is a hard limit and by per turn I mean per conversational utterance that we give them and this is the only text they directly reference every other piece of text they've read is encoded as numbers somewhere uh it's not directly readable as text current limits are roughly the size of a big novel technically speaking it's about a 128,000 tokens you might call it um a little bit over a 100,000 words 300 Page book something like that there's no direct text reference outside this window and older inputs in the text window Decay as new inputs arrive now there is a hack for this and I note that llms tend to hack this by reinges chats and so part of why Claude will tell you that you can reach a limit in a chat with Claude is because fundamentally on the back end Claude is is taking the entire chat that you have had about that subject every time you talk and reinus it as a single piece of text and so it's sort of like making the llm reread the entire conversation plus your new chat every time you talk and that helps llms to simulate the kind of responsiveness that and attention that humans show without the ability to have to remember every word of the conversation first and so when humans are having a conversation we don't really think about this I don't exactly know what our brains are doing but when we talk all we do is listen to what's being said and we come up with a response and we come up with a response that's contextual right that matters to the conversation when llms are responding to get to that kind of human fluency they have to reread the ire chat in the background and if you didn't know that that's okay you never see that happen that's something that's submitted on the back end so technically speaking a context window defines the maximum number of tokens usually in the thousands right there's there's really none of them now that are not in the thousands they can be processed together serving as the model's working memory for generating contextually relevant outputs so context window size is affected by tokenization and as I've discussed it impacts the model's ability to maintain coherence in longer responses and that also matters because if you're trying to get it to sort of do these lengthy responses if you're trying to get it to write your document for you it's reinus and rereading the document and that's why you sometimes get this idea of like alphabet soup when you get longer documents out of AI and that's why I tend to use AI more often for shorter tasks for bullets for things that I can expand into later because it doesn't do as well with those longer pieces of text all right let's get into prompt engineering prompt engineering is all about guiding an llm toward a desired response by carefully forming the input text you're framing the utterance just to your pattern recall for the llm you're providing examples to trigger specifics and by the way those can be positive or negative both are helpful and you're laying out very clear output expectations so technically speaking prompt engineering is designing your inputs with very specific structures or examples or instructions that guide the lm's generation process for new text the next token prediction that the llm relies on and improves response relevance and accuracy fundamentally you're saying I can prompt you with a set of tokens that are carefully structured such that you are triggered into a pattern recognition with particular relationships you've seen before between tokens in your general knowledge and then you're able to come back and recognize that pattern and predict a set of tokens which is exactly what they do when they write out that text on the screen that will be more relevant right that will be more useful to me and so it's all about being able to be inside the llm system and part of good prompt engineering is having a good mental working model of how llms work and that's why I'm doing this lesson because I think sometimes we think of them as black boxes and that doesn't lead to helpful prompts Okay so we've talked about foundational patterns we've talked about learning let's talk about emergent behaviors what are the unplanned behavioral patterns that are characterizing llms today in 2024 number one is emergent problem solving models trained on huge amounts of text are showing surprising capabilities like mathematics understanding now there are limits to things like mathematics understanding in a pure llm architecture but there are not really limits that we found if we adjust an llm and put it into a larger tool chain approach which I'll get to and sort of describe and I want to call that out because sometimes we see emergent problem solving that is useful for everyday tasks like I can now use a large language model in 2024 and if I say figure out the tip across six people it generally does it fine but if I'm solving International math Olympiad problems it will not do it fine because the llm is just not able as a text model to do that right now that being said the example I gave is still relevant because Google just won the silver medal in the international math Olympiad by using an llm and a tool chain approach approach with some other tools on the back end to solve very very difficult mathematics problems so this kind of llm emergent behavior is built on by humans so that we get more and more of what we're looking for whether it's within an llm natively or a larger architecture so how do llms do these emergent behaviors like we don't necessarily design them to be good at math when we teach them everything we've written down with human language that just happened well fundamentally absorb patterns that llms are good at understanding have wider applications we've built this massive pattern recognition machine and we've given it a huge amount of data to look at now when you give it prompts on top of that data set it can drive a novel recombination of patterns and so we are a part of this emergent problem solving experience too and we may not recognize that but our unique prompts are helpful and llms are inherent cently because of everything we've discussed previously very skilled at applying the patterns they know to new data so fundamentally what's happening is that llms when they show behaviors like mathematical reasoning are not actually doing mathematical reasoning they're still doing next token prediction so they still have the same complex interactions that drive uh relationships between models and extensive training data generating weights that they can go measure and use all of that foundational stuff we just talked about for text is exactly what they're using when you give them the what tip should I calculate problem all that's happening is that they weren't explicitly programmed to do any kind of math at all but they figured out a pattern in their data set that they could use and that was so successful it surpassed the initial expectations of designers designers didn't really design llms for math they just found out that they could do it when they actually built the system because there's a pattern in mathematics that is somewhere in the data set that is good enough that the llm can use next token prediction to do math somewhat reliably right it's again a pure llm not doing the international math Olympiad but yeah calculating the tip for dinner they can do that turns out maybe Humanities have written about that uh in fact this was reminding me of the Douglas Adams joke about the complexity of calculating tips at a tiny beastro and among six friends nice little aside there read Douglas Adams he's great so what other emergent capabilities do we have the other one I want to talk about is sort of on the other side we might consider emergent problem solving as good we might consider hallucinations as bad I use the same image for both to remind us that these are Flips of the coin we are assigning value here these are just inherent capabilities of the model and we need to understand how to use them I think it's honestly more accurate to say that llms are very very good at plausible sounding data because we built them to be and sometimes we interpret that as hallucinations but really all they're doing is using their next token architecture they don't think in facts unless we put a tool chain in place behind them to help them so pure llms are only predicting the next word they optimize for language flow which is why they're such good conversationalists which is why we been so uh surprised to see that they've been used as AI companions first and not in a lot of other ways that we would expect I think looking back maybe we shouldn't have been so surprised about that because language flow makes them sound human and again as I was saying hallucinations can be mitigated using a toolchain approach that gets into the fact checking that matters for that particular task now we are the ones that determine what is a hallucination so the famous example uh from I think it was Air Canada where the bot hallucinated a policy that wasn't there we assigned the value of hallucination to the bot's utterance right the bot just generated a response that it thought was plausible which is which it had done every other time and had a chat with a human in that system but in that particular case the plausible sounding response was a policy that had financial implications for the airline and we assigned that the value of hallucination and the airline had massive news headlines around the world and had to go and fix it and everything else the point is we humans need to think about where we apply the models that we've designed for next token prediction because part of this is just using them the way they should be used and part of it is building tool chains that help them to check facts what we should not be doing is expecting l s to magically know facts the way we do because as much as we talk about neural Nets they're not actually the same as our brains our brains do have symbolic logic and reasoning they do understand what facts are and llms just weren't built for that and so we shouldn't expect them to okay I want to close by reflecting on how llms are shaping us this is the first generally applicable technology in decades so what are some reliable indicators of how llms are starting to shape Society first massive personal productivity enhancement llms today are extraordinarily effective accelerating knowledge workflows I'm going to take a drink of water here extraordinarily effective there was a Danish survey that came out just a few weeks ago that talked about something like a 37% reported Improvement in personal productivity for knowledge workers in Denmark based on llms and it turns out that that's because Tech worker task knowledge worker tasks are pattern-driven llms can tackle many many of these tasks even without tuning because they're in the original data set which is why Tech workers all over the world have a chat GPT window open or another language model of their choice and I would say that that individual productivity is leading to based on my anecdotal kind of read of the situation team and or productivity one of the examples here in Tech right now is chat PRD which started out as an application for product managers and individual productivity has recently added on team plans team uh capabilities and that is just the tip of the iceberg like what we're seeing is that llms are following the path of least resistance where we start with individual productivity because it's designed as a call and response it's designed as an utterance and a responsive next token prediction and you have to think about larger architectures of software to build effective team productivity off of that basic flow but it's absolutely possible uh so watch that space right you should expect AUM more team in org productivity enhancements in 2025 this is also changing our skill set patterns so Tech worker skill sets knowledge worker skill sets have to shift and we need to think about allocating intelligence versus just applying our own intelligence what is appropriate for an llm as an intelligence versus our brain as an intelligence when do we use which is becoming a hot skill in Tech markets today so you have to know when to use an llm and I would argue you also have to understand that your value is a human brain has shifted from starting with drafting in a good draft to editing and polishing because llms are so good at drafting you no longer have to face a blank page problem and that is a 10,000 year old at least problem that is gone we just don't have it anymore and I think that's really cool and fundamentally a lot of the sort of rubric for allocating intelligence is having an internal quality dial and thinking about what are llms good at what are brains good at where is the quality meter for this task and what do I need to get to that quality meter most efficiently so I would expect that AI interaction AI oversight AI creative problem solving are things that we will continue to need to get better at I think building and sort of getting into code is something that we are going to do more and more because llms have been the greatest code unlock that I think I've ever seen they've simplified people's access to coding as a language because they look at coding as next token prediction too that's another emerging capability that they weren't necessarily designed for always check your code coming out of an llm by the way not always bug free just like a human all right another Factor here is pressure to monetize and that little guy there he's back he's thinking about the pressure to generate return on investment for Wall Street corporations are on track to spend roughly a trillion dollars on llms all in over the next couple of years and I'm factoring in both the costs that you have at the end of the stack where corporations are applying Ai and the estimate also includes the huge foundational model Investments and training Investments for building models that are are coming up if you're spending that much money there's pressure to generate a return on that investment we have not seen anything like that return there was a paper that came out by Sequoia just a month or so ago in June of 2024 that talks about this $600 billion shortfall where we have a gap between what we've spent on LMS and what we would expect to get as a return and it's not been closed and where we have applied llms our Focus has been on efficiency not growth and I think that is an issue that is associated with where we were at in the economic cycle when llms first broke we were not at a high point in the cycle and leaders were looking for things that helped them drive cost efficiencies and llms are something that you can get cost efficiency out of if if you put them in the right place in the org potentially and so that's where leaders of pigeon hold them but Business Leaders need to understand that creative applications and growth drivers are probably the bigger long-term value window here for llms and we need to think more broadly about what llms can do in order to realize a massive return on investment that would justify the cost of creating them in the first place right now most monetization is proxied via the cloud so if you're using cloud or compute to drive llm fine-tuning if you're using it to drive direct usage of large models like open AI that charge fundamentally that's turned into like Cloud Revenue at the Enterprise level so Enterprises will get a fine-tuned model that derives from chat GPT or that derives from some other model they'll put it on a cloud somewhere maybe it's on Azure maybe it's on Google Cloud maybe it's on AWS and then then the cash register Rings the way it usually does for cloud spend every time they use it right and that's how some of that monetization happens so I want you to just keep that one in mind because that one is going to continue to be a factor in the background of executive decisions around AI until we start to see substantial money back that for example is why Andy jossi decided to start charging for Alexa that's something that's apparently coming very soon and it's because he can no longer tolerate the cost on the balance sheet without direct return on the AI investment for Alexa all right new security risks LMS are breaking our mental models of deterministic security So Bad actors may never have been as simple as this idea of someone in a gray hat sitting at a computer far away typing in and sort of sending green lines of code charging across the screen the way we had in the movies but security risks were deterministic they were driven by code and the intent of a particular hacker these days they're more emergent we can have things like hallucinations as drivers of liability we talked about this with the Air Canada example we can have voice mimicry that's autonomous is a new spear fishing Vector people are using this in the wild already and it's concerning the ability to mimic a voice becomes the ability to mimic identity socially if you apply it in the right context and that generates new attack vectors and new vulnerabilities for all of us finally the scale at which you can create information and lm's propensity to focus on the flow of conversation rather than the facts means that it's never been easier to create disinformation and that risk which has already been probably 100x just from llm text outputs is 100x again when you throw in the potential to generate video and images because we are moving to a much more visual Society Tik Tok is exploding Instagram exploded back in the 2010s and people are consuming stuff via video you're watching this via video I promise I'm not an AI Avatar when you look at that General pattern it's easy to get afraid wow we have new vulnerabilities we have new attack vectors there are new security risks that's all true but you have to look at a new technology in terms of the overall impact to society and one of the things that I think is really compelling is that llms like most general purpose Technologies are being used both for incredibly positive applications they're being used in drug development and also for applications that are negative for society like we're discussing here on this slide and that's what happens when a new general purpose technology comes out and it's up to us as individuals as communities as companies to make use of llms in ways that benefit us as a whole and that is a nice turning point we are likely living at this moment in history that we will look back on as a huge inflection point for our species and I'm not talking about that with the assumption that we're going to get artificial general intelligence or we're all going to be like under skynet's rule shortly I'm actually saying just what we have today is showing us that large language model models May well go down as Humanity's greatest invention when all is said and done people may look back on this time and say wow I wished I lived during that time when everything was new and everything was on the horizon everything was something that we could shape that is the opportunity that is the challenge of large language models here in 2024 so there you go I hope you understand large language models a little bit better I hope you have a sense of how you can use them and uh I'll see you in the next lesson
