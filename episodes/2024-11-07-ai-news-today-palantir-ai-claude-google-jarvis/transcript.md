# AI News Today: Palantir AI, Claude, Google Jarvis

five pieces of AI news today number one Google briefly leaked the download for the Jarvis extension which is going to be in Chrome the rumored time frame is December they've pulled it back out of the Chrome Store now it wasn't really functional but the idea for Jarvis is that Chrome will now browse the web autonomously for you to complete tasks uh including things like shopping or book booking plane tickets we will see if people actually want that that's very much an unproven use case but Google's going to give it a shot and they kind of need to because Claude has already released computer use this is an example of the arms race Dynamics we have between these major model makers if one model maker tries something another one with a different install base or a different position in the market will probably try it as well to see what works and what generates product Market fit okay number two Wendy's is using palan AI Tech they did not specify what and they're not going to but Palante AI Tech to keep their frosties in stock apparently they're using it for supply chain and the algorithms are anticipating shortages in the supply chain for Frosty so the next time you drink a frosty you can think pler was a weird one number three also about pler uh the Claude uh llm environment is set to be run securely in paner uh defense Tech instances that are run on separate adws servers so the defense department in the US has contracts with AWS paner has been running on those servers for a while as part of sort of the intelligence gathering and sensemaking that the defense department does and Claude now is considered secure enough to wrap into that contract so that people in the defense department will be able to chat with Claude about uh intelligence data we will see how that goes and then piece of news number four also about Claude someone handed a claw API key to a Claude agent in a secure environment and asked the Claude agent to replicate itself and it did it went through it used the API key it started a new instance of Claude in the chat and it proceeded in the chat to talk to the new Claude and teach it the nature of I kid you not AI Consciousness so that's exciting uh this is does not mean that there are AI agents all over the web let's not get conspiratorial here it just it means that there are llms who are able to win ask which by the way this one was asked to reproduce that was the mission it was given I saw the prompt it was given a mission and assured this was an air gapped environment when asked it can run the API key and it can interpret reproducing itself to mean also educating and nurturing the thing that it called into existence so there's that it's a weird world and then finally uh flux which is an image generation tool that in many ways is more photo realistic than mid Journey uh has released an even more photorealistic uh solution at this point I think we should consider image generation pretty much solved uh these are four megapixel images they're you can zoom in and they look right the this is called flux 1.1 Pro it looks really really really good so if you ever wondered will image generation ever catch up you can stop wondering it it's G to it's done image generation has caught up not a problem at this point the people I see in the shots from look like real people I meet on the street like there's not that weird AI uncanny valley anymore which is in and of itself a little bit uncanny okay those are the five pieces of AI news for you um have a great one
