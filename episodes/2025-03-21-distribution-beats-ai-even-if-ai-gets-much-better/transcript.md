# Distribution beats AI, even if AI gets MUCH better

it is cold it is rainy it is dark outside and we are going to talk about distribution and why distribution matters more than AI so just get excited get the cocoa or if you're in a hot place I don't know get an ice coffee it's coming from a long-term perspective that I've shared here that other people have noticed that distribution is something that is not getting disrupted by AI the way a lot of the software production chain is it is getting easier it is getting cheaper to make software with AI it is not getting easier to distribute to people in fact arguably it's getting harder because there's more and more software scaling up and what's bringing this back to the top of my mind is an interview that Sam Alman gave and one of the things like he dropped a lot of things but one of the things he mentioned is that if he had to pick in five years knowing what Sam Alman knows now about how incredible AI is going to be between having a 1 billion user site where you have that regular traffic coming in and you've already acquired them or having the most advanced AI model he thinks the billion user site is going to be more economically advantageous to have sam Alman himself the model maker picks distribution he picks distribution and it's not just for consumers distribution matters for enterprise the reason why even though Clarna made a bunch of headlines and like trumpeted that they were going to leave Salesforce blah blah blah the reason why that didn't turn into a route for Salesforce is because Salesforce has an incredible distribution advantage salesforce is baked in everywhere you go if you walk away from it it is an extremely intentional decision and it requires a degree of focus from an organization that is by definition rare because most organizations are focused on fighting fires or one central objective that is tied to their core economic value they are not focused on their SAS stack and whether they can sort of clean it up so the fact that Salesforce is there that they have a distribution advantage and they have a network effect and they've got people who have worked for Salesforce with Salesforce everywhere in the industry that's irreplaceable that is why no matter how many pitch decks I see that are like we're going to beat Salesforce I never bet against Salesforce it's just the distribution advantage is too good it's not about the product i know they'd like you to believe it's about the product when they put Matthew McConna out there and he's sitting in the rain in a Paris cafe which was a real Super Bowl ad and it's like AI will help fix the rain for Matthew McConna no AI will not help fix the rain uh and I don't care about their product i care about their distribution this is why Gary Tan who is an investor when he asks people and he admits this when he asks founders a question after they do their pitch to him they run their pitch deck this is the most amazing thing what he likes to ask is "Hey that's great where are your customers?" And that's not a new insight like Gary's been asking that for a long long time but the the point is there's no substitute for getting the distribution and product market fit is basically a fancy way of saying a startup acquires a distribution advantage that's it either you have the distribution by having your customers or you do not have the distribution and the deal is and this is we are running into this it's it's a cretaceious level crisis for AI waiting to happen you have so many indie founders so many YC founders who are just incredibly excited about building building this year building building last year building through the rest of this year AI tooling out the wazoo like as as far as the I can see new AI tooling coming up they all need customers they all do and the competition has never been more insane i remember people saying that the 8,000 marketing tools in the marketing vertical was insane a few years back that's nothing compared to where we're at with AI right now it is just nothing at all there's like I think 50 70,000 depending on where where you count like it's a ridiculous number it's in the five figures it'll probably be six figures by the end of the year someone's going to have to go to the wall most of these people do not have distribution they have to pay for tokens somehow don't they they're not all paying for tokens out of their trust funds they don't all have trust funds because we've made software easier to create basically we've changed the supply and demand relationship to software and that has made distribution more valuable software is simple to create now i can create a calculator in two seconds that's fantastic how do I distribute it apple has distributed their calculator to a billion people people use Apple's calculator and that's a super simple example but you get the idea works for chatbots that works for any other piece of software distribution matters so if we think about that let's take that a step further distribution matters we have a bunch of companies that are going to go to the wall how do we think about the landscape that emerges who wins in that space the founders that win in that space are going to be less technical than the founders that won in the 2010s the builders and founders that win in that space are going to be probably more invested in sales net net like if you basically look at founding relationships it's either a sales guy or it's a tech guy most of the time and and I say guy because we all know that like the vast majority of founders are men not a great thing but it's true um and the sales side of things whether or not like maybe you're focusing on growth hacking for consumer that sort of consumer sales maybe you're focusing on B2B sales if you're in the B2B space someone who has the wizardry to figure out the funnel for that is going to be is going to be on the short path to riding in the private jets and becoming the billionaire and all the rest of it and I say that because the entire funnel is also getting disrupted this is why this is taking a while to like get into distribution is getting interesting precisely because the funnel itself for distribution is being disrupted by AI distribution is not changing acquiring customers remains really hard but the tool sets to do that people's buying behaviors are shifting people are talking about how chat GPT visibility is becoming the new SEO no one really knows what to do with that yet but if you search for yourself in chat GPT I guarantee you'll be surprised try it in Claude now that Claude has web search uh I was surprised frankly by what Claude found and how do you how do you game for that how do you make sure that you're visible in a way that an LLM understands stripe made an effort in that direction with LLM's.ext so their markdown for documents is there so that it's easy to ingest Stripe's famously good documentation if you're an LLM there's going to be more efforts in that direction those are efforts at distribution markdown for docs an effort at distribution and I think that what makes this whole space super interesting is that it is not like the 2010s where we all had the Uber playbook or we all had a playbook that we could run nobody has the playbook for nailing distribution right now nobody knows how B2B sales is going to change when people are more in the buyer seat because they're doing more of their research for what they buy in chat GPT than they are doing on G2 we don't have the answer for that there's a lot of people that are reinventing the existing pieces of the process and saying you can send more emails with AI but that may not be the way to handle that similarly with consumers if consumers are spending more time on Tik Tok and chat GPT what does the consumer funnel look like if it's consumer goods are you putting more into Tik Tok shop if it's consumer apps are you putting more into what how how do they find the app are you sticking with meta are you sticking with paid search are you looking for organic is this a personal productivity tool where you want to find people on X because they care about productivity you have to do all of that micro segmentation you can dig for them on Reddit maybe they're on Reddit the ability to segment and figure out who your customer is at a high level of fidelity and then understand where they are is the key whether it's in B2B or B TOC at getting to that distribution advantage and standing out in this world that is rapidly becoming a 100,000 AI app world where all of them need money and all of them need distribution and distribution has never mattered more getting the next model won't solve that it's up to someone who can figure out how to segment the audience and do distribution well so that's where I'm at rainy night we're talking about distribution what could be better let me know what you think about distribution
