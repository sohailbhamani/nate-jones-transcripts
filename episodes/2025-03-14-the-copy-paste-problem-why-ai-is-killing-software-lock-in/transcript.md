# The Copy-Paste Problem: Why AI is Killing Software Lock-In

so the last time I did this kind of a YouTube it was very unpopular so if you think this is terrible okay I'm doing it anyway i want to talk about something strategic i want to talk about a problem I see is critical in the AI industry that we are not talking about very much it's not ethics it's not security it's not privacy we talk about all those things no this is copy paste it's very simple fundamentally AI is enabling the cost of building anything to drop through the floor because the cost of intelligence is falling that's something we talk about all the time heck most of my YouTube channel is ways to build things that are getting easier and easier the problem is the old method no longer works if you have intelligence going through the floor and by the old method I mean the old strategy for software software in the 2010s was built around the idea that you could build a tool that people would be loyal to and that they would pay for it don't you love that my Slack is going off isn't that just appropriate uh that people would pay for and that when they paid for it they would be loyal to and so at the end of the day if I bought Salesforce I was stuck in Salesforce right and there was no way I was leaving well famously CLA in 2024 rebuilt and left Salesforce and embarrassed Mark Beni off publicly on stage and there was this whole thing but the point is not that CLA individually left Salesforce the point is is it is cheaper now to leave and that makes data interoperability more important and if that bores you I'm sorry you can move on but the point is really critical and you will live with it whether it bores you or not we all live on applications that use data essentially LLMs are taking the cost of intelligence and driving it through the floor but data is still stuck in silos data is still not easy to get out data is still really really hard to get back and forth it's why I call it the copy paste problem data is tough to move around i'm not talking about ETLs or pipelines if you're a data engineer what I'm saying is that fundamentally intelligence is only as good as the data it can operate against and intelligence is enabling us to produce synthetic tokens llm produce tokens all the time they're correctly categorized as synthetic tokens getting those synthetic tokens back into our work streams is miserably hard right now let me give you a few examples let's look at Claude claude produces a great little React component that I think is a nice design for a PM dashboard what do I do right now i can publish it and I can send it to my designer and and the designer can say I want to work on it but then how do they use it right like do they copy and paste it like that's really pluggy uh or my engineer can say I don't want it to be in React i want it to be in something else it should be in Typescript it should be in something else uh great why is it hard why is it hard to go from one tool to another i know the reason as a PM from the 2010s and the 2000s it's hard on purpose because you want to lock people into software i know that reason and I know that people still think that reason in boardrooms today people still think that reason in product organizations today but the problem is the loyalty ROI calculus has shifted and again if this bores you I don't care it really matters the loyalty ROI calculus is such now that no one is loyal to tools the way they were i am in a world as an AI builder where I will happily run two or three instances of lovable i'll run two or three instances of Bolt and I'll run an instance or two of wind surf and then something in cursor just because I'm trying to work at the problem from different angles i'm not particularly loyal to any given one of them i just want to see something come out at the other side if it works great i'm loyal to the product and the outcome i'm I care about the outcome that's it and the cost of refactoring and restarting is essentially zero so if I want to scrap a project and start a new instance in another tool cost me nothing almost nothing right like it's just not that much it's less than my cable bill um and so at that point why not restart and we would never dream of that level of of loyalty or lack of loyalty in the 2010s like we wouldn't touch that lack of loyalty with a 10-ft pole sas as a business model was not built on that and I am not the kind of person who thinks that SAS is dead that's been sort of much bihood and VCs talk about it all the time i actually don't think that's what this means good products with good distribution will build loyalty by making it easy to either execute entire data flows end to end so you don't need to leave the tool or by making it really really good at a particular piece of the data flow you care about and then by nailing the highways for data in and the highways for data out that's how you win loyalty and win in SAS and so when you think about it the the long-term perspective here is that tools that get good at data in and data out are going to be like Amazon in the 2010s that decided to care about returns nobody in retail cared about returns because everyone was like "If you make returns easier you lose money." Why on earth would we make returns easier that's freaking stupid well it turns out if you care about returns you breed long-term customer loyalty it's goods in and goods out right if you make it easy for people to get their goods back to you and get their money back out of your system they they feel more loyal the last time I had a good Amazon return experience was this week the last time I had a good return experience anywhere but Amazon was I can't remember and so the long-term loyalty that getting it right breeds is something that companies that looking looking at data need to think about if you are building an AI powered application you need to think about copy paste as a categorical fundamental problem set it is something that matters differently now because of the cost of intelligence i hope that made sense friday afternoon we're thinking outside the box here and I hope you enjoy it sharers
