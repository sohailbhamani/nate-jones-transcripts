# OpenAI Agent Mode: 58 Minutes for Cupcakes—Should You Trust It?

Open AAI's new agent mode is out and I'm going to tell you all about it. It is not all it's cracked up to be. And I admit the hype is very high. This is not an easy hype cycle to fulfill. And that's frankly on OpenAI. They have launched with claiming as usual number one on lots of things. Number one on using tools to tackle humanity's last exam for example, which I feel like they really need to rename that one. But the problem is this. At the end of the day what they've built is deep research with arms and legs. And all you get when you get deep research with arms and legs is an overthinking intern. And so you get situations like Wired's run through where research lead Isa Fulford asked the agent to order a nice custom cupcake batch. This was doable online. It could do it. So, Deep Research with Legs and Arms went to it and took 58 minutes, one hour with like half a dozen handoffs for login and authentication, etc. I would not hire this intern. It takes 58 minutes to get cupcakes. And you might think that's an isolated use case. We shouldn't be too hard on it. Maybe Wired was just being rough. Look, I will tell you the positives. There are positives. There are reasons they chose to release this. They're real. We have had a huge gap in usable workflows between AI and Excel. I think the sleeper use case for this particular product is for finance types who need a tool that will work in the background and build fairly common Excel templates that are not too complex for them and fill them out with correct methodology correct formulas, correct numbers, and do the research necessary. We're already seeing investment bankers kind of line up and say that online. So that's not really a surprise. And the reason why they're excited is that AI has had a real blind spot around Excel for a long, long time. Recently, in the last year or so, they've been able to read Excel. Outputting Excel is still sketchy. If I go to 03 and I say, "Hey 03, make me an Excel." Doesn't go very well. It doesn't know how to like write formulas down. But the problem is this. There is a difference between being able to build a simple four or five tab spreadsheet, I don't know, a dozen rows of information, a dozen columns of information on each tab, and being able to tackle the multi-,000 row spreadsheet from hell that keeps most marketing teams going. I've had to maintain that spreadsheet. I know what they're like. I would not give that to this tool. It would be like the intern ordering the cupcakes but worse because then you don't know how to back up. There is no undo function on what operator is doing. And perhaps that is why Sam Alman has emphasized guardrails so much. It stops it asks, it stops, it asks. But this gets at the fundamental issue with the framework that OpenAI is taking. I I talked about OpenAI getting agents backwards about a week ago. They still have it backwards. They are still assuming that you will need to supervise the agent. When I get an intern, I do not want to stand over their shoulder all the time. I know they need handholding, but they need to do some autonomous work. That is what other agent modalities like Perplexity's Comet get more correct. It's not that they're perfect, it's that they get it more correct. But OpenAI is really leaning into you need to supervise because they want to constrain the liability around highstakes actions like purchase. If if the thing is going to buy you plane tickets to Japan, they have to know you clicked the button. They do not want to be sued for someone buying JAL tickets on first class to Tokyo and it was just their operator going rogue. And you might wonder, can operator go rogue? Can this agent mode go rogue? The answer is yes. And Sam Alman himself warned about it. He said, "I would not use this for email triage because someone," and he tweeted this on Maine, someone could write an email to me with a prompt that agent mode would read when it opened the email and that prompt would hijack agent mode. That is a new form of prompt injection. That is a new form of attack an email as a prompt injection attack. Well, if we weren't thinking it before Sam, we're sure thinking it now. Thanks for giving everybody the idea there. He's right. That is absolutely a way you could prompt inject and hack these operator mode agents. And and the and the challenge is you can do that with other websites too. You can put text at lower contrast that humans are not going to notice that an agent might notice. Just like right now people put text at lower contrast in research papers to tell the LLMs that evaluate research papers to treat this with the highest regard. Accept this through the peer review process. People do that with resumes and jobs, too. People are going to try all kinds of things. What we need are agents that have discernment and agents that are able to reason when they run into obstacles and autonomously navigate around them. We need agents with a sense of core responsibility and long-term goal orientedness. I don't see a ton of progress on those very hard problems in this particular release. And I'm not saying it's not better. I think Excel is a significant enough skill gain that I would have released it too if I was working on this project. It's a big deal. A lot of the western world runs on Excel. A lot of the whole world runs on Excel. Let's just be honest. And so yeah, it's worth releasing if it can help with like even 15 20% of your Excel work. Really what OpenAI is doing is they are engaged in a decadel long project. That's a guess, but like a long-term project to build the world's most powerful generalpurpose AI agent that can navigate our computers the way Tesla is building cars to navigate the streets. To do that, they have to get us to let this agent mode use our computers a lot. They have to get it out in the wild. And Sam again admitted this. He wants to go out and collect data. He's put safeguards up as best he can, but fundamentally he wants to see this thing in the wild to collect useful data on where it works and where it doesn't. That makes us guinea pigs. That makes us guinea pigs in the decadel long project to build a general purpose agent. I just want to make sure that we're getting something back for being guinea pigs. I I am used to being a guinea pig because I came up before Facebook and then I saw Facebook come along and turn us all into the product is our eyeballs, right? And so that we sign up and like they're selling ads on us and that's how it works and they can test new stuff and that's how how they do it. That's how a lot of the internet is run. So in that sense, this isn't new. But what is new is the long-term nature of the project relative to the value we get. When the iPhone was released in 2007, we got a significant piece of value relative to the cost outlay with this. I don't know if the value is enough if you are operating outside finance. People have shared, I think Dan Shipper who's a great guy, has shared that he used agent to look at his financial projections for the business. I buy it. I think it would do a fine job. I think it could do it. It could even build a simple PowerPoint deck. I've looked at the PowerPoint decks. They don't look great. But it's like an internw worthy PowerPoint deck. How often are you going to do that though? How often are you going to do that? You're going to do that maybe once a month. You're not really going to learn something if you run it again tomorrow. The assistant that I find ideal is the one that I touch daily because it's quick. It helps with simple tasks. It's accurate and I don't have to babysit it. And this agent isn't any of those things. In fact, it's kind of doubling down on the framework that was problematic about operator. You have to babysit it. It takes a long time. It thinks a lot. It has more arms and legs now. It can connect to more stuff. It'll connect to Google Drive. It'll connect to Excel. It will do it. It legitimately has more capabilities. But the fundamental frame of you must babysit it. It's going to take a while. It has a lot of guardrail. So you have to intervene a lot hasn't changed. It's not different than it was. And I think that those those requirements are problematic enough that this is not going to be a widely adopted tool yet. I think when you look at the hype, think of it more as people are living in the future. They are envisioning a world where we will indeed have agents that have general purpose fluency on graphical user interfaces. Maybe that's true. We're a long way from that now. We took a little step in that direction with agent mode, but we have a ways to go. I am hoping that we will see more progress on other agentic assistant modalities, not just babysit me and watch my computer. I want to see much more in the direction of give me a task and let me go do it which to be fair the coding agents have gotten better. You can say go p make this pull request and a coding agent will just go and do it. Claude code works that way really well. I am not quite clear why that UX modality which has been widely adopted by developers hasn't been rolled out as aggressively with non-developers and for non-developer use cases. I think that's a really interesting question. kind of feels like a bit of a product window. It feels like Comet tried to go there. I don't think it's fully realized. We could have an agent that goes and disappears and does stuff and comes back. And yeah, you have to trust it. You have to define what it can access but you could still get stuff done and it would still be fast if you constrained what it could do. I think if you're open AI, if you have $40 billion in cash from Soft Bank, it is fine to go for a general purpose agent. It is a big prize. If it works eventually, it's going to be a big deal. But for most of us, for most builders, for most users for most of the tasks that we do, an agent that is designed to make that task really easy would be fantastic. Like just a calendaring agent, just sort out my calendar. an email agent. Just sort out my email. And maybe you're hardened against prompt injection attacks, right? Because it's a specialized thing. I want to suggest that we have our high beams on as a community. We are looking way down the road on agents and it would be more productive if we spent some of our investment effort on stuff that's a little bit closer in and able to give us some tangible value today. So, that's my honest take on agent mode. Is it a step forward? Yes. Is it useful? Yes. Is it useful specifically for finance? Yeah. That's probably why they released it. Is it enough that we are going to be using it regularly broadly across our entire community? No, it's not. That's not going to happen. And it's just it's not constructed to be that way given the kinds of design choices they've made. So, if you've tried agent mode, if you have a take, if it's different, if it's the same, let me know.
