# 10 career enders no one will tell you about and how to fix it (soft skills edition)

all right I did a video over on Tik Tok on like 10 things that are soft skills that can be career Enders if you don't figure them out and people don't generally tell them to you but what I didn't do is go through and talk about how to fix it and the reason why is frankly the format is too short and this is exactly what YouTube is this is for these longer form conversations so we're going to go through all 10 and I'm going to break them down and I'm going to show you how I think about them and how you can fix the soft skills and how you can tell if you have them right because at the end of the day is it really much use to you if you know that there might be a problem but you can't tell what it is and you can't tell how to fix it no it's not much use so we're going to make sure that doesn't happen so the number one thing I want to talk about is people won't tell you if you have a reputation for being hard to work with and so how do you know right well I will I will tell you how you know in my experience over multiple decades in Tech probably worked with thousands of people at this point all and the the number one thing that I notice about people who have a reputation for being hard to work with is that they are churny about their process they have what I would call noisy process so they have unnecessary meetings they call the boss in too much more than the boss is asked to be called in they get peers involved more than they really need to be and anyone who works with them recognizes that if they work with that person there's going to be a cost in terms of time or explaining and oftentimes noisy process looks like a lot of explaining the number two thing that this looks like by the way is being picky about your inputs now you might be in a world where the company has specified that your inputs have to be really precise a great example of this is if you work in a machine shop and you have really tight tolerance I actually built steel products and uh I've got welding scars on my hands um and I understand that sometimes you have to have tight tolerances but in those cases even if it's like in Tech and it's not like actual physical Goods you still have a opportunity to understand where the company has mandated those tolerances versus where you have and most of the time I find if you're working in Tech you have an opportunity to be much more flexible about your inputs if you want to be and by the way that Clues us into the fix right like a lot of the the key here is basically reverse engineering the inputs and so if you have a noisy process if you call unnecessary meetings if you talk to your boss more than maybe they want to be talked to focus on driving your process autonomously like own the process drive it you take care of it minimal meetings make sure you know the details if your boss needs to know them make sure the updates are on a Cadence your boss wants and that's it and just get it done and on the input side I call it opening your input aperture uh which is a silly way to put it but at the end of the day you just want to be more flexible about the kind of thing you can bring into your process and by the way everyone has process even CEOs have process and often they are very specific about it actually in as an example let's say as a product manager which I am I write a one pager and the one pager isn't perfect and there's like a missing section or I'm writing fast or I have like 90% of the requirements done and I hand it to engineering now I have to take ownership of that and say it's not where I want it to be right and that's my job but let's pretend for a minute that you're sitting in the tech leads chair you have two choices there you could either say go back and rework it and take a couple days or you could say okay this is good enough to get started on and let me just huddle with you quickly and I'll make a quick note on the thing that I'm not quite clear on and you can finish up in a bit the second way is going to lead you to have a better reputation to work with it just is all right moving on to the second uh one so that was number one you're hard to work with how do you know and what the solution is number two the reputation for being slow and by the way the way to tell that is to look at your peers who are doing similar work and to say am I BAS basically delivering something that's relevant that's of similar quality at a similar Cadence or similar timing that's it if you get farther in your career and there's only one of you at a company like right now I'm head of product at a company and there's only one of me part of how I Benchmark how I'm doing is by looking at other peers who are in my job at other companies and looking at the Cadence of their releases looking at the quality of their releases and I judge myself and by the way I don't give myself a free pass like part of this is being honest with your s and so if you want to get better you have to sort of get that competitive Spirit engaged a little bit you have to say Okay well I'm G to do better I'm going to beat my peers I just as a game with myself I don't have to brag about it I don't have to talk about it I don't have to admit to anybody it's a competition but I'm going to beat my peers number three people can sometimes have a reputation for complaining if you are often the person who is bringing it up quote unquote or starting the conversation down the sort of path of complaining what you'll notice is that people frequently get nervous around you or maybe you don't notice it and that's why you're here but whether you realize it or not people find it really worrying when you complain about work at work because it's dangerous because you don't know who's listening you don't know who they'll talk to especially if it starts to get personal especially if you talk about individual people you have to be absolutely sure the person you're talking to is not going to towel on you for lack of a better term this is going back to elementary school social dynamics but that's really what it is and even if you're sure it's usually not a good idea and the reason for that is you're putting your breath into complaining instead of into fixing what you can fix and instead of into nurturing positive Dynamics which is actually almost more important in situations that are really toxic if you can put your energy into nurturing at least a small positive dynamic in your space it's going to give you more bandwidth to engage in your work to survive your day like all the stuff that people talk about complaining doesn't really fix it even if it's soft stuff even it's even if it's stuff around how difficult the workplace Dynamic is and you can't fix it complaining still doesn't make it better it still makes it worse um and so my suggestion here is if it's it's it's sort of feeling habitual for you and like you kind of know you do it but like it's really hard not to because it's so obvious see if you can find another topic for a bit um look I have a corgi talking about dogs is usually a winner I'm not necessarily some someone I would describe as always a dog person but I do find that that's like a helpful topic of conversation for a lot of people because a lot of people like dogs they like to hear what the dog did and like it's a light topic and you can pick something different right pick hats pick going on a hike pick whatever you want pick a movie just find a way to switch the topics so you switch the track in your head and that's how you kind of undo the complaining track all right number four icing or cake this sounds like some kind of comedy routine but the the truth is you don't get credit for doing the extra stuff at work the icing if you're not doing the core stuff which is the cake and so if anyone has had to ask you where is the cake and they don't mean it literally they mean like where is the chord deliverable for your work in the last month or two stop doing anything that is extra until you figure out what is going on there just focus on delivering on the cake just bake the cake for like a month see if you can do it perfectly and that's it's really simple on that on that one uh so that's one two three four uh and then the fifth one is sometimes people will focus on others or on the past or anything that they don't have to take ownership for they'll sort of like deflect right so if you ever find yourself saying well that's why that's a clue and the the solution there is actually to it's in your head practice a game where the reason why is always you and I don't say that because I want you to blame yourself etc etc that's usually not productive it's because if you practice that game you're rewiring your brain a little bit so your brain doesn't always go to like running away from the responsibility it doesn't always go to well it's you know it's the manager over there and they're the ones that are keeping me from delivering my project and if you practice that game you're going to find that you probably have more control in the situation than you realize and you are also going to have a better reputation for focusing on stuff you own which tends to lead to more positive social dynamics for your career all right let's keep rolling here uh lack of flexibility that is the next one so this is time spent like explaining the edges of your work that's how I describe it so if you if you find a you spend a ton of time saying I don't do that I do do that this is The Edge this is what I don't do and you spend almost more time on that than on the work itself you are probably in a situation where you need to be more flexible and you're probably the inflexible person and the solution for that is simply to say I don't know if it's my job or not it seems like it might be close I'll pick it up and own it just try that for a bit and I'm not saying try that to the point where you literally can't do anything else I'm not saying try it to the point where your core work suffers as we talked about that already in the cake versus icing problem but you usually have room to pick up a couple of pieces here and there and you can do that and you can change your reputation on whether or not you're flexible okay so where are we so flexibility was number 1 2 3 4 five six so now number seven I can count uh you got to own your activity and and not your impact if that's you that's a problem you got to own your impact first always and so if you catch yourself saying stuff like oh I did my part like I did my part I wrote the code and uh it went to it's the product manager's fault that like it didn't work I've talked with Engineers like that that is not a fun conversation um own the impact and it it's actually one of the quickest ways to build your career and it's a really simple way to reverse engineer because if your response instead of saying well I did my part is to say well let's see what happened and how we can fix it that's a much more Curious mindset it's a mindset that admits the problem is real and the issue like driving impact is real and it admits that you can play a part in driving it and that's what people are looking for in people who want to grow their careers okay uh the next one this is the second to last one this is number nine um if you are not showing enough dedication to the problem it's a problem if you say it's not my problem or if you say you know what I'm out of here and and my challenge to you by the way that the solution here is not overwork the solution here is to become the office expert on a problem space that is relevant to your area if you become the person to go to the subject matter expert on an area relevant to your discipline so people go to you and they know that you care about it and you can address it that's a huge career hack that's the solve all right number 10 socially awkward people give you sidelong glances people step away from you in convos people make excuses you find it really really hard to have people not like walk in and close their backs to you in a circle in social situations and by the way this is all like I'm talking about IRL social situations here but this also happens on Zoom or Google meet and you can find that people will like sort of glaze over when you say something in the first five minutes of the zoom call and they move on if if this happens to you one that's how you know and two it is a big problem whether we like it or not people are social creatures and if you cannot work how work out how to be social it's going to be an issue and the key is actually recognizing the purpose of conversation in a work setting it's supposed to be fairly brief it's supposed to be lights it's supposed to be novel and so there's a little bit of an entertainment quality to it and you kind of want to find something where it's like oh that's kind of a new fact or that's an interesting thing and that's why people talk about what happened this weekend they're looking for like a novel thing that can talk about because it's recent we haven't talked about it yet um and so find something that you can talk about that sort of fits in that novel and like category and that is going to depend on you on what you know on your interests it's going to depend on your co-workers and the culture you're in so I like to talk about my dog I talk about my dog I like to talk about hiking I do hikes I live in the Pacific Northwest whatever it is for you find something that's relatively light and novel and talk all right so I did the 10 number one you're hard to work with number two your slow versus your peers number three you complain a lot number four you do the icing work and not the cake work number five you focus on others you focus on the past you don't focus on what you own number six lack of flexibility number seven you're owning only your activity and not your impact number eight you are not showing dedication to the problem and number nine did I not did I do nine not 10 oh well whatever we'll figure it out this was a good run uh your so awkward it is too early in the morning and I need to have coffee I broke down all of those problems for you I talked about how you understand the inputs that drive those and I talked about how you solve for them leave comments and let me know other ones you want me to address um or areas where it wasn't quite clear and I can do another video cheers
