# Why the Best AI Tools Look NOTHING Like ChatGPT

I did a survey of hundreds of AI tools and the best AI tools out there today do not look like chat GPT and I wanted to do a whole video breaking down the patterns I learned digging into these new tool launches because everybody's building AI chat interfaces it seems like and the companies actually starting to drive adoption, print money, and grow fast are building something else entirely. And here's what I learned as I laded up all of these tools that I looked into. The winning pattern isn't better prompts plus smarter models equals AI. The winning pattern is collapsing the distance between AI and the artifact that you need to ship. In other words, the best tools do not look like chat GPT because they operate where your work already lives and they output the exact thing that you would otherwise produce manually. So, I looked at hundreds of tools and I picked the top, call it 12 to 15 tools that are going to matter the most because they illustrate this new way of working. Think of these as canaries in the coal mine, right? Like they illustrate new ways of working that bring the AI and the artifact close together. You're going to see more tools like this in the future. And I think it's really important that we find them because otherwise we default to the brands we know. We default to Anthropic, we default to Chad GPT, etc. Let's not do that. Instead, let's look for tools that are new, innovative, give us direct outputs that are useful, and most important of all, have the potential to replace something in the budget. That was one of my standards when I was evaluating these tools because I don't know about you, but for me, it is not worth it to add yet another AI tool to the stack if I'm having to add to the budget, too. I want to have the potential to trade something out of the software budget and put something new in. And that's my goal here. So, I'm going to run through four of them that I think really illustrate the trend, and I'm going to put the whole list down on Substack for you to check out. The thing that I want you to keep in mind as we go through this tool list is how different these are from the conventional AI workflow. Think about it. The conventional AI workflow is you leave your work surface, your database, your editor, your chat, whatever, and you describe what you want somewhere else with the AI, and then you copy the output back, and then you manually finish up that last mile. People think that's AI but that is the gap actually where AI productivity goes to die and these tools show it. So let's get to the first tool. So this is Dreamlit. Dreamlit builds transactional emails inside Superbase in natural chat. You just describe it. You preview it with large live database rows and you send. That's it. You can vibe code your way to an email campaign. The reason this matters is that this is illustrating how durable the vibe coding mega trend is. The idea of an entire startup that combines vibe coding and superbase but isn't a website builder would not have been possible without lovable, without bolt, without these tools that make vibe coding a thing. It is now such a big deal. It is possible to build an entire startup that just focuses on helping vibe coders to run email campaigns. And so instead of copying over query results or SQL results from your database rows in Superbase into another tool like Mailchimp, you are actually writing emails where your current vibecoded operation operational data already flows. So the database console becomes the email builder, right? This is the inversion. Instead of bringing the data to the AI, you're bringing the AI to where the data lives. That is the theme. We see that with other tools that are coming out that I'll talk about as well. The key is the AI should exist where that work substrate already occurs and vibe coders have made it so that superbase is where so much operational data lives. It just makes sense for a tool like Dreamlet to I love this because it takes the existing motion the existing workflow that vibe coders already use and says why not just do this for emails where your data lives. It's it's a no-brainer if you're in that space. Let's go to tool number two. Tool number two is Stricks. It's a security agent with a difference. It doesn't just report vulnerabilities. It exploits the vulnerabilities. It's okay. It's okay. It exploits them first. It captures proof and then it files findings. In other words, Stricks knows that security professionals are not just going to say, "AI told me it's true." Right? Security professionals are cautious. The ones I talk to are still trying to figure out how AI plays a productive role inside a defense perimeter. Strick solves that by forcing AI to prove its work. So instead of asking, can I trust this AI security analysis, you can say, I don't care whether I trust the analysis, I trust the exploit log. I can see that the vulnerability is real because there was an exploit. So if stricks can't prove it, Stricks just doesn't report it. The pattern is pretty simple. Deterministic verification here beats probabilistic claims. When you're coming to enterprise software, there's a bunch of startups. I've started to see a bunch of tools I've started to see that insist on showing receipts instead of confidence scores. And that is a big theme we're going to see already this year, already in some of the tools I found and going into next year. Let's get to tool number three. Tool number three is called MEM 2.0. It is calendar and Slack monitoring that proactively surfaces relevant notes before your next meeting. You don't ask, it just knows. And so most of your best context already exists in notes, right? And the problem we always have, I know I have, is that I write the notes and it goes into this giant pile. Maybe it's in a word doc, maybe it's in Apple notes, maybe it's like typed as an extra note in granola, whatever, and I forget about it. MEM's job is not to generate new content for you. Unlike most AI, right? MEM's job is to resurface the right content at decision time. So the interaction flips from write a query to generate to observe the context around you and then retrieve the alert. In other words, MEM is a memory prosthetic. MEM is not a content engine. And the pattern that makes sense here is that recall will beat generation for knowledge work if the recall is accurate, useful, timely, and correct. And that is what MEM seeks to do. And I'm super interested in this pattern because I think we're going to see a lot of cases where we already have the knowledge inside the enterprise, inside your notes somewhere, and just bringing it back proactively is tremendously useful. Let's get to tool number four. Caesar is a super interesting tool. It's brand new. You can vibe code your way to an agent. Sure, we've all seen that before, but this is an agent that clicks buttons across web, desktop, and mobile when APIs don't exist. It's an extension of computer use for agents. What's interesting here is that two big automation paths are emerging right now. deep integrations like uh there there's tools that like comet right the browser I've talked about they use API or data interfaces to interact but tools like Caesar control everything else they go where tools don't they go where the data ins and outs aren't written yet and if we're honest that's most of the web I have really complicated feelings about these tools and that's part of why I'm surfacing them I think that there is a tremendous amount of potential in getting LLMs to operate interfaces the way we do, even if it's a hard problem. And I think tools like Caesar point the way toward a solution. This is a pragmatic solution that will exceed API stability for longtail applications. Right? I'm saying like if you have a set of integrations that you need to keep an eye on for example and you want to write an agent that just keeps an eye on a bunch of integrations for you that are in your longtail something like Caesar is going to beat datari integrations that are driven by MCP servers because not everyone's going to have an MCP server in other words if you can just own the interface the user sees then you can actually automate it and even if for some apps the data integration is going to be stronger and faster the advantage that this app has that Caesar has is that it goes everywhere. What I compare it to is the idea that you have a jeep that can go all terrain, any road, doesn't matter, up the dirt track into Moab National Park if that's your thing on rock. That's fine, right? Like the Jeep can go anywhere. Caesar can go anywhere. Now, it may not be the fastest car, right? Like if you need a Ferrari to run on a racetrack, you're not going to go with this solution, but it's going to get the job done regardless. And I think that that calls out yet again how we are pushing AI to be where we are. We are pushing AI into the human interface. So we've looked at a few of these tools. There's a bunch more. Let's zoom back a little bit. Let's pull back to the unified patterns that we see. Number one, these tools collapse the gap between output and shipped work. I want to reiterate that Dreamlet ships emails from the database console. Stricks ships exploit validated reports right into your issue tracker. MEM is going to ship reminders before your meeting starts right where you are. Caesar ships completed tasks across apps without an API. And this shifts buyer questions. It shifts our expectations, which is why I'm doing this video. Instead of can AI do this, which I hear way too often, I want us to be asking a better question. Does this tool own the last mile to the work artifact I need? That is so much more useful. And if it doesn't, go find one that does because I bet it exists. So, who's going to win in this space? If we zoom back, these are four example tools. I did not pick them for special reasons other than they seem to have utility. They have great reviews and they operate against this principle and I think they're worth highlighting, right? Nobody paid me for this. I'm just trying to highlight some examples for you. The principles that will separate winners in this space from losers, from rappers, from zombies are pretty simple. I think after looking at hundreds of apps, I think I can boil it down. Data proximity is going to win. Operate where your work already flows. So, it's less work and you don't have to open a separate portal. This is something I think that Dreamlet does a great job of highlighting. If you are already there and the AI is already there, you're just going to win. Determinism is back is the second principle, right? Determinism over vibes. having proof, having citations, having verified diffs, having exploits you can show like stricks, it's going to be confident scores. Just prove it, right? If the AI can prove it, great. Third is if you own the artifact, not the draft, you're going to win. If it is good enough to be the actual email, if it is good enough to be the actual report in the task, you're not leaving the tool. So the companies that are building these, they're not trying to replace Chad GPT. They're asking what if AI lived inside the tools you already use and finished the work instead of just starting it. And I think that's a pretty interesting takeaway and a pretty interesting trend we're not talking enough about in October 2025. Good luck. What tool will you use?
