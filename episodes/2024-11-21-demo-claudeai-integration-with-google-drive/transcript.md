# Demo: Claude.AI Integration with Google Drive

Claude released a new feature and I think it's really cool no it's not a new model it's actually just an integration that makes your life so much easier for me I've spent a ton of time copying and pasting text into Claude I've downloaded Google Docs into docx format and I've reuploaded it that all goes away you just directly integrate I'm going to show you a quick screen share so you can see what it looks like so here we are in Claude you can see I'm on the professional plan I believe this is only for paying clients and so you're not going to get this on the free plan yet you can see my model there and I just paste in a recent Google doc it fetches it I hit enter and it immediately reads the doc and begins chatting with me now I don't actually need it to do all of this so I am happy to just interrupt it and say hey what is the output for a skeptical student that would be useful to understand about this doc there you go and it goes on and like assesses basically the course write up I have and like looks at like who it's best for and the benefits and all of that look the point is not for me to show this course it is a nice course I think it's it's helpful but the point is to let you know how easy this is to actually work with I can just paste the link in so that's what you get and I think it's really fun and I hope you use it I know I will be all the time
