# The secret to getting better at job interviews: your job is to de-risk your candidacy for the role

you know what I wish people understood I wish people understood that when they apply for a job the hiring manager's role is to reduce the risk of the hire and I wanted to make a longer video here because this is such a core concept that is at the back of almost every hiring manager's head often at the back of every recruiter's head too and applicants if you've never been a hiring manager before often don't understand that and so this entire video is basically going to be a breakdown of seven different moments in the hiring Journey where you as an applicant can distinguish yourself can stand out in a world where the hiring manager is trying to drisk the hire we're going to explore that relationship between what the hiring manager needs out of the process and what you can show so number one I want to talk about your passion for the specific role look in 2024 that is a hard thing to ask for I totally understand we're talking about a thousand applications in some cases if you've been in the job search for a while and so it's hard to show passion when you do get that call back when you do get that interview but even if it's difficult it doesn't make it less important because on the other side of the table the hiring manager absolutely needs to see passion for the role to feel like they have the signal that would get them confidence that this person is the right one for the role that they are a low risk higher that's really critical and so on your side if you can show passion for that specific role not even just for the industry I often hear people stop and say well I have passion for this industry there there are a lot of other companies in most Industries it's very rare for there to be only one company in an industry so show passion for that particular company and make sure you're loud and proud and clear about it when you start talking right from the first call with the recruiter okay so that's the first kind of piece I wanted to talk through talking about how you can drisk by showing passion for that particular company in that particular world number two is actually even before the interview stage it's Clarity in your resume writing one of the things that your hiring manager needs to have confidence in is that you can write well and I don't mean write flowery fancy language I mean write really clearly so they can understand you and their colleagues can understand you this is not a YouTube video about how to optimize your resume in general we might do that another time this is a focused specific tip for helping hiring managers to understand you're not a risk and you can do that even at the resume section by being super clear in the way you phrase your bullets I know there may be keywords you need to work in but if you can write a real really clear sentence that articulates this is what I did this was the distinct change that I made in an existing system and this was the results it really helps them understand the impact you're capable of if you write your bullets clearly they act like front doors that invite the hiring manager to ask you specific questions in the interviews and those questions should be against your strong suits because that's what you're putting into that resume in the first place so resume Clarity makes the rest of your interview process easier and communicates again that it's less risky to hire you because you can communicate well all right that's the second tip the third tip is around case studies so oftentimes especially in 2023 2024 hiring managers are trying to use case studies as a way to gauge actual work there's been a lot of discussion on this in the broader community there been questions about whether these should be paid exercises or not that's not what this is about what I'm trying to focus on is how you can utilize a case study to make sure that you can articulate that you are going to be direct about the questions you are asked at work because fundamentally every case study is a question it's a question set to you and the manager is looking to assess whether you can answer a direct question clearly one of the most common fail modes for case studies is an applicant will come through with a case study and they will do so much extra work it's really clear they spent way more hours than they needed to or that or even than they were asked to and at the end of it all what they have is a lot of what I call Frills and not the core answer or they spend very little time on the core answer and most of their time on the Frills and I think the applicant's intent is to show how much breadth they have but what comes across is that they can't answer the question directly it's really really really important to answer the question clearly and directly that should be at the center of any case study you do because again you're telling the hiring manager I am not a risky hire because I can answer questions clearly and directly okay that's the third one the fourth one this starts right at the recruiter conversation if you still do cover letters it starts with a cover letter you want to be really clear about the intention you have with your career so this is actually more important the more senior you get you can kind of get away with less of this if you are applying for entry-level roles or maybe it's your second role in Tech but if you are at your third role in Tech or later you need to be really clear about the intention behind your career or else it's going to be seen as a red flag and the reason for that is that a hiring manager wants to be confident that if they make the hire they are not going to have to make a higher again shortly and so some people talk about this as they look at the uh begin dates and end dates and see your tenure and then they see are you the kind of person who stays around that does sometimes happen but because of the upheaval in teex since 2020 there have also been a lot of short ten years that are not really the candidates faults and so that is becoming less of a reliable signal and instead what people are starting to do is they're starting to look and see can the candidate explain the story of their career in a way that makes it clear that this next spot with us is the spot they want to be in for a very good reason for their career long term if they can that is a huge floss because it means that they know how to tell their story communicate intentionality and that you as a hiring manager can be confident not only that they are a lower risk hire but that they are the kind of person who you can coach because if you have more intention as a hiring manager your career development job with that person is going to be really easy because you just want to help them draw out that intention and again that's one of those things that most applicants aren't really doing clearly and that when you do it helps you really distinguish your candidacy okay that's all in kind of the early mid phases right those four tips about passion for the role res to make Clarity case studies making sure that you are intentional in your career I want to now talk about the second part where you get into the later stages maybe you're in the loop stage where you're talking to five or six people in a row how do you convey that you're a lowrisk higher when it's down to two or three people so number one is about precise fit this is again this is a loop stage thing most people don't have an assessment of whether you're precise fit earlier than that in this situ ation you want to read the question Trends maybe across multiple different people you talk with and where you see that they are focusing more or they're double clicking into your experience set you can make an inference that that is the area of weakness they are trying to fix in the role and you should focus your stories there to show that you are a strong candidate for that exact week week spot that they want to close and this takes some experience but you can usually start to see it when you listen for it or watch for it and that's why I'm telling you if you if you don't know to watch for it you might miss it but if you know to watch for it you'll look at the patterns and the questions and say where are they focusing on are they really focusing for example on Market competition are they focusing a lot on go to market are they focusing a lot on technical foundations they're going to tell you by the questions they ask and you can show you're a strong candidate by focusing the stories you tell them back around that area to show you're a strong candidate there again it's drisking the higher okay the second of three tips for that late stage in the interview process avoid the weak yeses okay so you're going to talk to people in a loop situation who are going to be once a week type relationships in your workplace they're the people who are colleagues but you're not necessarily working with them every single day all the time those people are not there to assess whether you can do the job they're there to assess whether you can work well with them and your job in that situation is to make sure that they don't walk away saying oh they were fine right I had no real objections but I also didn't get a strong signal of this is an amazing person if I'm being honest I have seen a lot of that and what that comes down to is a lack of clarity and a lack of commitment around making sure that you can show your understanding of that relationship at a very detailed level and that you've done that exact work relationship before so I I'll say that one more time fundamentally they are going to walk away with a stronger yes if they have Clarity from you that you have done that work relationship before that you understand both the things that work and the things that don't and you are committed to making it an absolutely excellent work relationship so their lives are easier because they will often tell you through their line of questioning where the weak spots in that working relationship have been so far hey we've really struggled to get clear marketing materials out of product tell me how you've addressed that those kinds of questions come up a lot you want to be sure that you are able to talk about really clearly with a lot of passion how you fix those exact issues it kind of goes back to that tip I gave you earlier in this video around answering the direct question in the case study in this case you're answering the direct question about the relationship between this role and a colleague that you will work with sometimes but not all the time if you can do that directly and do that with passion and show your excitement for that working relationship and then do that across the whole Loop you are going to come out with more strong yeses from people who could often be neutral in these situations because when we do the debrief It's usually the hiring manager and maybe one or two other people who work very close with the role who have strong opinions everyone else often is ambivalent they're like ah they were good but I don't have a super strong opinion it is rare to have most people have strong opinions and when that happens it is almost always a higher and so this is one of those things where if you can figure it out it will increase your chances of success in the loop the last tip I have for you late in the loop stage you want to be positioning yourself with a hiring manager and with people you work with closely as if you were already a colleague and they can imagine working with you when you are at this stage what they need to see is the signal that they could work with you on day one and you can just dive into the details you won't be confused you won't be flumed you won't be wondering which way is up but you will be focused you'll be saying this is what I need to do this is the next step this is how I solve this and what they'll do to find that out is they'll ask you questions and often times ask you questions that are designed to talk about exactly the issues they face and so when I talked about precise fit a few minutes ago this is an even more specific version of that just for hiring managers and people you work with closely they are looking not only for precise fit but for a colleague they can work with who fits the role and so you have to both convey that you can do the job precisely and also convey that you can do it with them and so that's where you want to come back and say I solve this problem in this way by collaborating with these specific people who were in your role before this is how I worked with my hiring manager before when we Face challenges communicating product prioritization to my director things like that right where you can show a specific example from the question set they're asking that talks about how you are not only a precise fit but a precise fit who works with the hiring manager who works with those around you really really well to solve problems so that when they think of themselves working with you what they see is oh my gosh this person is a fantastic solution this is the solution I have been waiting for this is the person I can work with and I'm going to close there because if you want to look at a larger hack for this whole idea of drisking the hire the larger hack is that you are conveying across the entire cycle of hiring that you are a colleague they can imagine working with if you want to take one thing away from the video that is what you should take you want to be the colleague they can imagine working with and those are the people that get hired and that's where I'm going to leave it and uh let me know what I missed in the comments
