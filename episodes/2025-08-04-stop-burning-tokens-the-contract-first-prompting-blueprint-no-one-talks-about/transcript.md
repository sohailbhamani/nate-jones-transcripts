# Stop Burning Tokens: The Contract-First Prompting Blueprint No One Talks About

Almost every prompt that fails fails because intent wasn't clearly communicated. Human language is really, really rough on intent. And it's not just a function of a particular language. It's not just a function of the fact that it's human language. It's really the fact that we as individual people bring so much domain expertise. We bring so much passion. We bring so much energy, so much experience to a particular subject we want to work on. and we try and convey it in these these words to the LLM and say please work on this with me and I will tell you even as someone who's relatively experienced with prompting it is also frustrating for me sometimes I also struggle with getting that intent across in a way the LLM understands. I want to suggest a technique I haven't seen elsewhere that I've had success with to you today. It's called contract first prompting. And you might think to yourself contracts like are we signing things? No, that's not what I mean. I mean contracts in the sense that engineering teams use them where they write contracts and agreements with one another about how their microservices will interact, what the service level agreement will be, what the latency will be, all these technical specifications. In the same way, we need to get to a point where we have very tight technical shared understanding with the LLM of the meaningful work we want to do together before it starts to work. And that has been very difficult to do. And I am not satisfied with the usual answer here, which is just ask the LLM to ask some clarifying questions. People report success with that. I have also had some success with that. But I want to emphasize to you that that is a very scattershot unprofessional approach to actually dealing with this issue. You are giving the LLM, which is swimming in a sea of ambiguity, free reign to pick a question that it thinks may help. you are not really giving it any parameters or structure around that question set so that it knows that it got it right and it knows that it understood your intent. And that is why asking clarifying questions can be helpful but not sufficient. So what's better? What does contract first prompting look like? Well, I'm so glad you asked. We're going to actually look at a prompt I wrote that illustrates contract first prompting and I am going to talk you through. It's quite fun. Okay, here we are. I want to call out each of the key elements here. I am not a believer of like trying to claim to you that there are magic words in prompting. Everything has a reason, but obviously you are going to be able to also build these in ways that are useful to you. So, it's not that this is the only way to build a contract first prompt. I want you to walk away with the intent, not the magic words. First of all, it's always good to give an LLM a mission. Uh, your goal is to turn my rough idea into a very clear work order. I am assuming you have work that matters here. So maybe it's building educational materials or a PowerPoint presentation or the script for a PowerPoint presentation. I don't expect Chad GPT to do a great job with a PowerPoint presentation. Uh or maybe it's building software. Whatever it is is meaningful work and it will deliver the work only after both of us agree it's right, which is the critical sort of contract piece to this. So what goes into this? Number one, we need to make sure that it understands what are the gaps to goal, what are the gaps to intent. And so when you write and sort of print this thing initially into the chat and you say go, it's first going to say, I'm ready. What do you need? And you're just going to write out a rambling sentence or two because so often when we're defining work, we don't know any more than a sentence or two. And that's what sort of stops people from doing a better job uh prompting initially. So you just write what you have, right? It can be really messy. It's then going to go into sort of number zero here and silently scan and list every fact or constraint that it still needs. And then it's going to start digging. It's going to ask one question at a time until it gets to 95% confidence that it can ship the correct result. And this gives it some examples of places to dig for purpose, audience, facts, success criteria, length, text stack, if code, edge cases, risk, tolerance, etc. But I will tell you from experience running this prompt, that is not an exhaustive list. It will go other places. So an example here that's really useful, I wanted to really stretch it with a highly ambiguous human prompt. And so I asked it for a 500word summary of the history of the Bacans since 1660. Why? Cuz that's pretty ambiguous. There's a lot that goes on since 1660 in the Bacans. And you know what it figured out? It figured out that one of the key leverage points to writing a good 500word summary was how it was going to handle the evolution of political entities and their naming conventions across all of that time period. it needed to figure out what kind of scope I wanted so it could cover the arc of history in a way that made sense for my work assignment. And so even though it wasn't named as a constraint, it had three or four rounds of questions for me asking me to pull apart my intentions around political entity discussion and description for this 500word uh description. And by the way, why did I put 500 words? Because I wanted to challenge it. Shorter is harder than longer here. and it eventually got to something that was a really solid summary of Bach and history since 1660 in 1600 words. And all of that clarification was really helpful. The echo check is when it thinks it's close. So, it replies with a crisp sentence. It states the deliverable. It states something that it knows it needs to include and it states a hard constraint that is designed to make it a very easily readable summary of work that you can engage with. And then this prompt has what is effectively a mini program inside. You can say yes and lock it. You can edit it. You can ask for a blueprint or outline of what's going on. Or you can call out the risks uh and ask the LM to define what's risky about the prompt as it stands. And it gives it it gives it directions for what to do here. How do you handle yes to lock is very intuitive, edits as intuitive, but it defines blueprints and arrest so the LLM understands it. When it's building and self- testing, it gives it special instructions for how to handle code. So, it's responsible and reminds it to review code, which is something that I could have extended into documents, etc., but code is often errorprone, and so I thought that was worth it. Um, and it gives you the option to reset. This is really short. You might wonder, how on earth does this work? Well, it turns out you don't necessarily need a long prompt to get to contract first intent. You just need clarity around the sequence of steps. All we're doing is we're saying, one, list the gaps to goal, which I almost never see in prompts. Two, dig for those gaps until you get to 95% confidence. And then from there, offer a path forward that I can choose and control because we're trying to write a contract together. Is this the only way to write contract first intents? Absolutely not. It's not the only way. Is it a really useful way to talk about getting to clarity of intent? Yes. And I didn't just do this with history. I did it with software. I actually have been working on a software project because I'm interested in centralizing comments in live streams across multiple channels. So I've been playing around with a software idea for that. And I it's it's again it's ambiguous. How many channels? What do I include? What counts? What's what's an MVP? The number of users. All of these things that I could like try and put into a heavy PRD prompt initially, but I'm not really there yet. I really want to just talk about it and I want to talk about it in a structured way. this was really useful for that because I could actually say I really want you to produce a PRD for this but I don't have the intent yet and so dig with me until we get to a agreed contract of work to produce a PRD with clean clear intent and it did. Now if you look at that and that and that feels really obvious to you congratulations that means that it should exist in the world and you should try it. But I will tell you I have done a fair bit of digging. It is not as obvious as you would think. This is not a technique that I can find other places. And I'm a little bit surprised because I think it's a very token efficient way of getting to clarity of intent when we assume that humans are humans. And I'm increasingly interested in prompting techniques that assume that humans are humans. We are not perfect. We do not always write the full prompt out. We do not always have the full crisp complete intent. In fact, mostly we don't have any of those things. What we have is a vague human idea backed by a tremendous amount of context and experience and we need help fishing that out of our heads and getting to clarity. That is what a contract first approach to prompting seeks to do. How can we get to a point where the LLM deeply, fully, completely understands your intent with this piece of work in a way that you can just converse with it and and like let it ask you questions and let it dig out for you. You might think this is only for product managers like PMs need to get clarity on intent when writing requirements or it's only for this or only for that. This is a very intentionally wide-ranging prompt set. It is supposed to be something that is workable for virtually any piece of serious work where you need to define intent first. And I wrote it that way on purpose because I think our use cases for AI are really wide ranging. any survey you see, any white paper you see on how we use AI, we do a lot of different kinds of serious work. But the common failure mode remains clarity of intent. That is what this is designed to fix. So if this was fun, if you enjoyed it, great. Go run some contract first prompts. Tell me how they worked for you. Or if you already have a word for this or if you're already using this, I would love to hear about it. So often when I do these prompt videos, people say, "Oh yeah, I have a different word for this, but I've been trying it at home. I didn't know it was a thing." It's part of why we talk about this is that like we learn together what the common terms of art are. So there you go. Contract first prompting.
