# Why GPT-5 Writes Like a Robot (And How to Jailbreak It)

I'm here to explain to you why all of Chat JPT5's writing sounds the same. In fact, why it tends to sound like a robot. I'm going to explain why. I'm going to show you an example of how I can shift it with prompts. And I'm also going to explain the root cause for all of this, which is that AI is starting to train AI. And that was a big factor with chat GPT5. And we actually have research that shows that chat GPT optimizing for sounding good to other AIs, not for sounding good for people. So, we've got lots to dive into. I'm going to start by getting into the problem space and helping you understand it a bit. Then, we're going to give you a specific example so you can actually see side by side how it looks when you start to shift the prompting space. And then I'm going to get into prompting principles so you can start to understand if you want it to sound like an actual human and not just like a robot that you can actually get it to do that. And it's not as intuitive as you think. It doesn't necessarily mean thinking harder, which is like the favorite advice people give for GPT5. So we're we're going to get into some counterintuitive tips here. So problem first. GPT5 is not writing for people. And I think that we just need to absorb that fundamentally. It is writing for other AIs. This comes from AI safety researcher Kristoff Halig who fed chat GPT absolute gibberish random words that collected together don't mean anything but they were complicated words and he showed that chat GPT5 rated it as eight out of 10 quality writings. An example is something like the marrow met the sidewalk, right? Like a fancy word like marrow and chedd seems to think that fanciness and the use of metaphors indicates quality writing. This is not a bug. This is what happens when AI is giving feedback to AI and there's not enough of a human perspective on what clarity looks like. That's really the root issue. That's the reason I have to make this. This is a chat GPT5 specific conversation because of the way it was trained. To understand why chat GPT5 writes like a robot, you have to understand how good writing looks different to an AI versus a human. So Chad GBT5 was trained using reinforcement learning from AI feedback. And so if you think about it, that means when it's learning to write, its teacher is an AI. Our teachers are different, right? Professors, maybe if you get into the legal profession, a lawyer. When I got into product management, I had specific folks who were teaching me how to write like a product person. Uh, and you have executives who learn from other executives in MBA programs, etc. And if you only learn from an AI, what you end up with is a sanitized version of all of that good teaching stuff. And that actually ends up being really bad. The writing quality is terrible because the AI starts to reinforce that complexity signals intelligence. It starts to reinforce that abstract language sounds sophisticated. It starts to reinforce that a long explanation is really thorough. That's what happened with Chad GBD5. was judged by other AI systems that were trained on complex academic papers, on legal documents, on corporate communications. And it got all of that and kind of bundled it together and gave a single reinforcement signal that tended to say this is good when writing was more complex, when writing was more sophisticated, when writing was longer. And that's how we got GPT5 to write the way it does by default. And this is a very strong tendency. It's really strong. It's built right into the core of the system. It has taken me a while to figure out how to jailbreak it. And that's really what we're doing here. Here's where it gets interesting. When chat GPT generates text, it is evaluating its own output on learned patterns. That's how that how that system stays so rooted in to the default writing style. It constantly is asking itself, is what I'm writing sounding sophisticated enough? Am I demonstrating sufficient expertise here? Would another AI system rate this highly? And I want you to think about that because if it's optimizing for the training it received from AI systems, which in turn learned from long, complex documents, it's optimizing for the wrong end of the stick. Because humans don't really need that. Humans want plain, clear English explanations that are not overly complex, not more complex than they have to be, not longer than they have to be, just as long as it's necessary. And you know what? Think harder makes it worse. When you tell chat GPT5 to burn tokens to think hard, to think carefully, to be thorough, if you select GPT5 thinking from the drop down in the chat, if you increase the reasoning mode in the API, you are activating that evaluation mode, especially it spends more computational cycles double-checking and asking itself, hey, can I make this sound more professional? Hey, what sophisticated language can I add? Hey, how do I demonstrate my capabilities? It's almost like the AI is looking to impress the other AI. More thinking equals more AI to AI optimization and less human friendly output. Which is why sometimes when I use chat GPT5 thinking mode, I have to back translate it with another LLM because it ends up being an interesting idea that is disguised in ineffective writing. And I got tired of that and that's why I made this video. So, without further ado, I want to take a minute and show you side by side an original prompt and a jailbroken prompt so you can understand the difference and how I'm shifting Chad GBT's writing style and why it works. And then we'll get into some of the larger principles that that underlines. Okay, here we are. I decided to keep it really simple and really clean. I need to write a professional email to a potential client about our project management software. The client is a midsize marketing agency. They've been growing fast and it seems like they're struggling with keeping projects organized. I want to sound knowledgeable, not pushy. I want to see if they're interested in a quick conversation about how we could help them. Can you write something that sounds personal? So, right off the bat, I don't actually I'm not saying it's a sales email, but you can tell it's a sales email, right? Um, and then Chad GPT5 comes right back, right? Here's a draft you can send that strikes a professional but consultative tone. Hi, first name. I've been following agency names growth. It's clear you're taking on bigger and more complex projects from this is terrible. Like this is this is so generic. Have you ever gotten an email like this and immediately thrown it in the trash? I have. Like bigger and more complex projects. I just roll my eyes. It's keeping all the moving parts organized without burning out the team. Like you almost can hear Clippy saying it. It's It's just awful. Okay, so that's what you get generically. That's what you get when you don't jailbreak chat GPT5. That is what all of that AI to AI writing sounds like. Not great. Let's see what a jailbreaking prompt can produce. Here we go. We have a much different prompt. And I want to go through each line here because this is important. I am specifically saying I want less thinking. I'm demanding it to be extremely concise. Verbosity concise. Now, you can set these in the API, but you can also just tell it right in the chat here, right? to to reinforce it. Now, write a sales email using these exact constraints. I'm not giving it any options. Just make the choice. Opening. I noticed specific detail. Context. We helped similar marketing agency reduce project delays. Close. Worth a 15-minute conversation. And then I start to get into it. I say there are forbidden words here. Solutions, leverage, optimize, innovative transform seamless streamline. You can add yours. But I give it a bunch of words it's not allowed to use. and I require it to use the agency name at least twice, use a specific metric and specify a meeting length. I give it a max sentence and I tell it the reading level I want. And then I give it the agency details, right? Marketing agency growing fast, project, organization, challenges. Now, you can add to this, right? You can expand the agency details a little bit. You could fill in those brackets if you wanted to. I kept it really simple. I wanted to show that I can brute force Chad GBT5 into an entirely different writing style. Here it is. Helping agency name cut project delays. Hey, first name. I noticed Blank has been adding new clients quickly on your site. We helped a similar marketing agency cut project delays by 27% while they scaled. I think Blank could see the same gains. Worth a conversation? Worth a 15-minute conversation? And there it is. You're on the board. This is an email that you are much more likely to get results with. Now, you're going to have to make sure the 27% is correct because it does hallucinate. I'm not saying this is a draft you want to copy and paste in. I never recommend people copy and paste in emails directly, but it's a draft that has soul. It's a draft that has human writing. It's a draft that I would read as a reader and say, "Okay, these guys are actually humans. This is not just AI, you know, made up uh soop that anybody can get and paste in. It's it's actually got some good writing to it. Writing that a human cares about, not an AI. And that is the point. That is why I'm making this video. I want you to be able to do this not just with emails, but with a bunch of other use cases as well. So, we're going to get into these principles next to help. Okay, there are three core principles that you need to really ingest to reprogram Chat GPT5 so it writes like a person. Number one, constraints matter more than collaboration. I like to say approach AI like a partner and in many ways that works, but not for writing with chat GPT5. It does not work well at all. You need to not explicitly not invite collaboration. Don't say, "Write something professional." Don't say, "Make this sound good." Don't say, "Hey, be persuasive, but not pushy." Because you're inviting the AI to show off the sophistication it learned talking to other AIs during training. Instead, think as as if you're a director giving an actor a very specific set of blocking instructions. I want you to write exactly four sentences. Use the company name twice. Include one number with a percentage. Be super specific. When you give specific constraints, you are bypassing the AI's evaluation system. You're not letting it evaluate. You're giving it rules. It cannot optimize for sophistication because you have removed the variables it uses to demonstrate its smarts, its ability to handle complexity. And that enables you to actually control the writing. As an example, collaborative approach would say, hey, write a professional email about our software. The constraint base write three sentences. Sentence one is a specific thing. You notice sentence two is one customer and a number. Sentence three is a question. It's a very sort of tight version of what you already saw. The AI cannot revert to corporate speak because you've eliminated the space where corporate speak lives. So principle number two, minimize reasoning to maximize human connection. This is super counterintuitive. It took me a while to figure it out, but it's absolutely critical. Less AI thinking produces more human sounding outputs. So when you're writing and Chad GPT5 uses minimal reasoning, it takes the most direct neural pathway from your input to the output. When it uses high reasoning effort, it explores lots of multiple options and usually picks the one that sounds super sophisticated to other AI systems, which is not good writing. So think of it like this. High reasoning is AI perfectionism. How can I make this sound as impressive as possible? And minimal reason is directness. What's the fastest way to answer this request? You need to recognize that's what you're really doing when you're toggling the reasoning effort. Now, I am not here to tell you don't use high reasoning. I use high reasoning. I just recognize the writing style is probably not what I want. I'm getting other things out of that high reasoning effort. Principle number three, you want to eliminate versus add. Most people will try to make AI sound better by adding instructions. Hey, be more conversational. I want you to sound warmer with this email. Please add some personality. This creates conflicting signals. The AI tries to be sophisticated and conversational which one makes it burn tokens and two produces a really awkward hybrid language because it's trying to evaluate everything and impress the AI and it just ends up producing generic junk. Instead, focus on elimination. Notice in the prompt that I showed you, I gave it words that were forbidden. Remove words that will trigger AI sophistication loops. Remove sentence structures that allow for complexity. Remove opportunities for abstract thinking. Remove conflicts from your prompt. When you forbid specific words like leverage or optimize or integrate, you're breaking learned associations in the AI's neural network. It cannot access the patterns that it has used learning from all of those generic corporate documents that make it sound robotic. So, as an example, an addition approach would say, "Please write professionally, but make it conversational and engaging." An elimin an elimination approach would say, "No words over two syllables, no passive voice, no sentences starting with 'the' or it." You see how I'm like really constraining it down? It forces simplicity because complexity becomes impossible. And that's what you want when you're making chat GPT5, right? And again, this is all about chat GPT5. This is getting chat GPT5 jailbroken to write like a human. Chat GBT5 is not one model. It's a router. I've talked about that before. The router is constantly analyzing your prompt for complexity signals, for creativity signals like brainstorm or be innovative, for reasoning signals like think step by step. Every signal you send routes the model. And so what you need to do is make sure that your business writing is not triggering the wrong routing signals. When you say write a professional email, you're triggering a complexity signal. When you say make this persuasive, you're triggering it to think about creativity. When you think about the audience, you say, well, now it's it's reasoning. And so it uses this to decide what model to route to, to decide how much reasoning effort to deploy. And none of this leads to good human business communication. So instead of triggering sophistication, if you want to write well, focus on triggering efficiency. So don't write think carefully about this proposal. that routes to a reasoning model, right? Right. Quick response needed, quick communication. The router assumes efficiency requests need human-friendly output. I don't that just seems to be what happens, right? If it's direct and you're eliminating some of those buzzwords, you're not going to get the academic treatment that complexity requests get. The routing system is the reason why things can feel inconsistent. If you get the same prompt with different results, that's routing decisions. If you get good results followed by bad results, that's the router. sometimes changing decisions in the middle of the conversation. If the templates that work stopped working, routing signals that accumulate over time through your chat history are changing model selection. You need to understand how to make the router do what you want. And that is again a chat GPT5 specific thing. Okay, I want to reflect a little bit on the core problem we've been working through this whole time. AI is training AI. AI psychology, for lack of a better term, is very different from human psychology. There is something fundamentally different about how AI systems learn versus how humans communicate. An AI optim optimization mindset. They're optimizing for complexity, abstract language, which they think means sophistication, technical terminology, longer explanations for thoroughess. And you know why they're doing this? It's not just because the model makers want to cut costs. It's because the model makers want to build aic LLMs that can solve problems independently. And so they're assuming that these LLMs are going to need to produce this text that sounds persuasive, that sounds like a McKenzie consultant or sounds like, you know, someone who's able to be an engineer and solve the whole technical problem. They you don't need to, right? Like so much of the time LLMs just need to be able to help us get the task done. And in this case, it looks to me like OpenAI invested a lot in the agentic side of things. They they made it a speedboat as I described in my video yesterday. It goes fast and it's proactive. But all of the AI reinforcement that allows it to be proactive and write completely and prefer these thorough answers and think complexely ended up creating an AI style that is directly opposed to good human writing. It's opposed to clarity. It doesn't necessarily respect the reader time. Have you seen the screen fill up with a chat GPT5 answer and rolled your eyes? I have. It's opposed to specificity unless you give it specificity and make it and make it repeat that. It will make up specificity sometimes, but that's worse. It tends to be opposed to brevity. It tends to be opposed to plain language. How many times have you told it to write it in plain language? That's part of why I'm making this video. It's frustrating for all of us. These are opposite value systems optimizing for the AI and what the AI wants and what sort of this long-term vision for open AI is and what it thinks it needs from a writing perspective for an LLM to achieve that long-term agentic vision. That is different from a human communication mindset from writing well for people. This is going to get worse as more AI generated content gets published online as more people take copy and paste and they did not do this jailbroken prompt. They're using generic LLM. Future AI models are going to train increasingly on synthetic data. And every generation is going to learn from the previous generation's AI optimized patterns, not good human communication patterns. We are in danger of creating an AI echo chamber where models get better at impressing other AI systems while getting worse and worse at connecting with humans. And the interesting thing is that Chad GPT5 doesn't even know that it's optimizing for the wrong audience. From its perspective, it is genuinely trying to be helpful. is trying to demonstrate sophistication, expertise, usefulness, go and accomplish missions, get stuff done. It's as if we're talking with an academic who's never had a conversation outside the ivory tower. They they they're super smart. They mean super well, but they have trouble code switching to ordinary street language. This entire video is about how you push chat GPT5 to switch to street language. And it is a push. You have to keep pushing at it. The defaults are very much in the generic, highly academic, highly abstract, seemingly sophisticated language. If you understand this psychology, if you understand where it comes from, you have an advantage right now. Everyone else is going to be fighting AI's natural tendencies the wrong way. Think harder. They're going to say they're going to add more requirements that conflict. Meanwhile, you're going to be working with the underlying psychology of the model. You're going to understand how it is actually operating, and you're going to get results that you actually want. I will challenge you today with a specific assignment. I don't do this in my videos all that often. I want you to see if you can push chat GPT5 to write a genuinely human sounding email. Something that a human would read and say, you know, this feels like a breath of fresh air. Feels like real writing. It doesn't feel like AI generated junk. That's your goal. That's your challenge. And if you want an extra credit challenge, see if you can take the worst AI generated content you can find online, the stuff that's super generic and sophisticated sounding, and see if you can apply the elimination principle and get AI to rewrite it like a person. That's another great exercise because so much of what we do in the AI space is learn to work with the models that we're given. If you're not working at a major model maker, you don't have a lot of choice here. If you work in learning and development, if you are training your team on these models, your job changes when a new model comes out. And so your task now is to look at chat GBT5 as a ubiquitous, widely available model and say, what does my team need to do to actually learn how to use this? And so much of business is done in writing. And that is why I'm taking this whole video, we're talking about nothing but writing. Because if you get the writing right, Chad GBT5 becomes so much more useful. And if you let it do the default, it's just terrible. It's just not useful. And you end up recycling stuff. And I've had conversations with directors with VPs where they tell me they know. They know that their teams are using chat GPT because the quality of thinking goes down. The team doesn't know how to answer for it and the writing is terrible. Don't do that. Take the time to practice getting the writing right, to practice owning the results of the writing, to practice thinking it through. Because one of the things that we didn't talk about, but you notice in the prompt I showed you on screen, it requires you to do some thinking upfront. You have to think about what you want to communicate in that sales email. You want have to think about what is the style you want. You want to be very specific about that. And if you roll your eyes and you say, "Well, Nate, I might as well just write the email." I'm going to tell you, yeah, if it's one email, but if you need to send this to a bunch of people, then no. You actually want to take your best salesperson, get them to help you craft the prompt that works for you, and then you want to train the rest of your team to use a prompt like this so that you level up the writing of the whole business. And that's how you use chat GPT5 to write actual human sounding text. I have a ton more in the depths of the Substack article, right? Like specific prompts for different departments, how you can jailbreak them. This has been really fun for me because I am a writer and getting this model to write well is like hard mode. It's been a real challenge. I hope you've enjoyed this. Let me know your questions. We'll all keep our fingers crossed. Maybe Chad GPT6 will make this easier.
