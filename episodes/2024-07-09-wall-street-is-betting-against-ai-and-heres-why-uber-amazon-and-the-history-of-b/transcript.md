# Wall Street is betting against AI, and here's why: Uber, Amazon and the history of bets against tech

I want to break down the problem we have around how you monetize Ai and we're going to do it in depth and the reason we care is because there is nowhere that we are spending more right now in Tech than AI That's why Nvidia stock is going through the roof and the thing that I want to call out is that we don't have a clear picture of AI monetization we don't know where AI money is going to come from we have a lot of hopes and dreams but it's not clear yet and I want to actually paint the picture because I have my gray hairs I earn them I want to go back a decade or more into another era of tech and I want to talk about how this moment is reminding me a little bit of uber and the hyper subsidized ride hailing experience that we got in the 2010s so Uber's investors spent approximately $30 billion over a 10-year period on subsidizing the ride hailing habits of Americans and they paid so much money that they changed people's habits people moved away from taxis and the BET was once you change people's habits they will stick with them even if you raise prices and by and large taxis have not come back and Uber is making due with a combination of increased prices up like 100% in some places and with Uber Eats which is uh very profitable for them and actually they're their sort of biggest driver of profit margin going forward and I'm thinking about that because at the end of the day what we have with AI is similar except the numbers are way way way bigger we're talking about potentially a trillion dollars in expenses over the next few years uh at least according to a Goldman Soxs research not that came out uh I think it was this week last week something like that and if you're going to spend a trillion dollars on things and you're looking for a conventional five or 10x return on investment that means that you need five to 10 trillion dollar in revenue for the company's investing in that Capital expense to make this work and so far the only ones who are making an enormous amount of money on AI are companies like Nvidia that are as we put it selling these picks and shovels in the Gold Rush they're selling chips that other companies can use to train large language models and that is moving right like they are selling bucket loads they can't keep them on the shelves but if you go a level F farther up in the stock and you look at what are the companies that are using those chips selling with AI you don't come up with a lot yet and that is one of the biggest question marks in t right now so for example Sequoia treats this as a $600 billion Revenue Gap and they've updated that that by a fair bit since just the start of the year I think they they doubled or tripled it uh this was according to a research note they put out asking where the revenue for AI was going to come from and that was only last month that Revenue Gap keeps growing every month as companies invest more in AI on the hope of future revenue and so my question is the Uber question how long will investors tolerate this kind of capital expenditure how long will the markets tolerate if you're a publicly traded company and where do you expect the revenue to come from I want to put forward three different options that I think are historically plausible for where AI could pull that revenue from number one is a massive lift in productivity and the reason I put that at number one is because I think that large language models most useful and interesting use cases for lack of a better term are around how you can be creative we we made these large language models with the assumption that they would be logical that was our default assumption for artificial intelligence in movie after movie after movie after movie The Narrative in science fiction was that way the way we talked about AI even before 2020 was that way in TCH it's just not that that way that large language models that became popular across the globe are highly creative we invented creative AI first and because we did that what we are getting is an opportunity for productivity growth that we are all coming to terms with and so if you want to look for like where is a place where you could get a surprising amount of money I think one of the options is breakthrough productivity driven by AI creativity and that is not going to look like the efficiency gains that most companies are banking on it's going to be much more growing the top of the funnel it's going to be much more focused on how you can uh grow your sales your Revenue how you can as a company invent a new product I know that people are using large language models for research applications because open AI has talked about it those are the kinds of things that could yield disproportionate benefits imagine the re line impact if a large language model leads to a breakthrough that unlocks a new drug class right and now it's a hundred billion $200 billion and there you start to attack that Revenue line right there that is not how Wall Street typically thinks about the potential of new technologies because Wall Street is typically geared toward thinking about it in terms of efficiency gains and so one of the things that I think is an inherent tension is that Wall Street is not really buying this larger vision that Sam Alman and others in the AI futurist uh movement have embraced W Street doesn't see the dollars and cents adding up and Sam is basically saying and his friends and and his colleagues and the rest of folks in Tech who are close to Ai and who believe in it are saying just be patient we will get there we will see what happens one of the analogies that comes to mind for me as a former Amazonian is Wall Street also didn't buy Amazon web services for a long time I Vivid remember picking up the magazine where uh I think it was Time Magazine and it was like Jeff you should keep the store was the headline and it was like an entire article dedicated an entire issue dedicated to this idea that Amazon was branching out inappropriately from retail and should not get into cloud computing and we all know how that went right at the end of the day AWS is doing pretty well but the monetization wasn't obvious similarly for prime if you look at the dollars and cents case for prime it does doesn't add up it's actually a fairly well-known story like if you look at whether or not it made sense to launch Amazon Prime the cost of two-day shipping way outweighed the expected monetary value and what people didn't realize was that by taking away that mental block that came with calculating shipping you were going to unlock a ton of new Demand on the internet for e-commerce and that's what Amazon ended up doing uh it was a case of uh what we call uh jv's par jens's Paradox uh it's basically a case where if you drop cost down you see demand go way through the roof in this case Amazon drops the cost of shipping they remove this mental walk demand Rises so where does that us at the end of the day AI is sort of in the place where Amazon was when it was deciding on Prime where Amazon was deciding on AWS where Uber was when they were trying to figure out how you monetize off these cheap ridu subsid AI as a collection of companies as a movement as a vertical intact is looking for monetization they need it otherwise the capital expenditure doesn't justify so my first case was AI is creative maybe we find ways with AI creativity like a drug breakthrough or something like that and we start to chip away that Revenue G that my second is the efficiency gains but I want to ask where that comes from and why because I think people tend to assume efficiency gains mean job losses and going back to Jen's Paradox I actually don't think that's true here I think efficiency gains are likely to lead to more demand for the work that is done efficiently and that's something companies are missing right now and so I think instead of looking at it as we can get stuff done with lower costs yes maybe the unit economics Dro maybe it costs less to run a marketing campaign but you can now do cooler marketing campaigns and so maybe the dollar costs don't drop and that's something that again Wall Street may not be calculating in as much like they tend to look at it as very linear and I think that's one of the things that will be interesting to see is do we see these anecdotal reports where people are saying I am getting more done but there is always more work to do and therefore even though AI has helped me a lot I'm just getting through more of my infinite to-do list it's not like the infinite to-do list has actually gotten shorter and I think anecdotally for a lot of us in Tech it is an infinite to to-do list and there's always things we could be doing and AI is simply helping us to get to like 60% of it versus 40% of it and so even if the productivity gain is Big it may not come through in like reduced salary costs or layoffs which by the way is something that is really interesting to think about there's some anecdotal evidence that that there are layoffs associated with AI that are happening they're mostly anticipatory it's mostly around we think we can get away with this and it's mostly associated with companies that have been struggling anyway and are kind of looking for something that gives them a narrative to turn the company around it's less about hard productivity gains in practice driving hard layoffs that one doesn't happen as much at least not yet we will see so to me that second one around efficiency gains is actually more about how can a company get more done cover more territory given the same Workforce for and we do see like I I see a lot more conversation around people delaying hiring or slowing on hiring because they think they can get more done with the same number that one may not be true in practice in the sense that people may be overd delaying they may be taking that productivity lift for granted too much people may get tired they may burn out they may switch rolls who knows but there's more to it there than there is is from a hard edged productivity cut perspective so I want to pause there so wrapping up the efficiency thing I think there's two ways we play this right we have hard Edge productivity Cuts uh and job losses from AI I don't see much evidence of that there's a few companies that are doing that that are already in trouble and they're anticipating I don't think they're actually like facing it on hard edged facts of productivity in their company for the most part and there's also the softer ones where they're slower ring higher ing because they see more efficiency and my general Point here is that if we are getting to more of our infinite to-do lists you're not going to see that show up in the dollars and cents of the company because well we all have infinite to-do list right even if we're seeing huge efficiency gains so what is the third way we could monetize I talked about the massive lift of uh creativity the example was what if we find a new drug I talked about efficiency gains a couple of ways we can play that and the last one I want to talk about is New Markets and new devices one of the things that's really interesting is that we've mostly interacted with large language models through a chatot experience well what if it's not just a chat imagine a world where you start to pair a large language model with an inhome household robot that is a device class that doesn't exist yet that is a device class that people have speculated may be worthwhile since the 50s and we certainly have well-known entrepreneurs going after that device class right now building it right now with the explicit goal of inventing a new home device that people will pay a lot of money for because it's such a labor saver around the home I don't know the future we will have to see what happens but one of the ways you pay off on llms is if suddenly they are effectively the operating system that powers the most ubiquitous roll out of a new device since the iPhone and then layer on top of that what happens if they're also powering iPhones essentially because Apple's in the middle of powering up their iPhones to do AI it was a big factor in WWDC and they may be more cautious than many but they're still going after so I want to wrap this up and give you a sense of how I feel about it and where I land on this I agree we have a big Revenue gap on AI it is not trivial I also agree that we are spending at a massive rate and the people who are winning right now in this space are the people who make chips which is mostly Nvidia we do have monetization that we need to find if we are proponents of AI if we feel like there's value there I think that the three options we have are essentially find ways where we can be more efficient and I don't see that as equivalent to job losses find ways to use lm's creativity to find breakthroughs and unlock disproportionate gains and I see a play for devices as well does that add up to 5 to 10 trillion I don't know this isn't a math podcast we will have to see how it plays out but if I were to pull on those threads and say where is the use case that companies who are investing hard money are anticipating those are the three that I would go after tell me what did I miss
