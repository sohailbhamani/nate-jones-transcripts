# OpenAI o1 and o1 Pro are OUT Today: Here's why Pro costs $200--breakdown of OpenAI pricing strategy

I cannot keep up with the news today open aai has dropped 01 they have dropped 01 Pro they have a 12 Days of Christmas theme so more is coming and I was just about to make a post on the strategy that open AI is using for pricing so here's what we're going to do we're going to talk briefly about 01 and 01 Pro and what what they are and then we're going to talk about the pricing strategy because it's highly relevant because guess what 01 Pro is $200 a month pull out your pocketbooks so why did they release them together what are they good for both 01 and 01 Pro look like from the tests that they like they are much better at coding and Science and Mathematics this is the direction that openai has been hinting they're going at in 2025 this absolutely validates that now you might wonder what is the difference between 01 which is available in the 20 Buck plans and 01 Pro which is going to cost $200 a month like you can go play with o1 now you can go play with it in the plus plan well the difference seems to be if you are a PhD researcher in science or mathematics or potentially someone who needs expert level code analysis you would be willing to pay 200 bucks a month for somewhat better performance versus even 01 and 01 from the testing looks substantially better from 01 preview so I'm going to link the full paper on the test results dive in play with it let me know what you think I'm sure a dozen video bloggers are right now making posts on the differences between 01 Pro and 01 we will know within 24 hours what what the internet thinks but let's get to the unit economics why did they price it at $200 the reason has to do with the game they're playing so as a model maker open AI is inherently negative cash flow they cannot spend any less than they are currently spending and hope to reach their ultimate goal of reaching super intelligence first in fact they should probably be spending more and yet their subscriptions their cash flow is all based on what they currently have in Market which is not super intelligence it's not even general intelligence it's a large language model it's extremely good they keep getting better we're going to have debates in the next few days on whether 01 Pro reaches general intelligence I guarantee it but regardless if it's available and you're paying for it you are paying for a trailing Edge indicator in their strategy they've already shipped it they have to monetize that piece of intelligence and somehow invest 10x more 100x more in what's coming inherently their business model is negative cash flow and they are only charging people 20 bucks a month and they reveal like the CFO and Sam both gave interesting sort of interviews in the last couple weeks and they revealed some fundamental numbers numbers that suggest to me they have to raise prices which is why I'm not surprised by 200 bucks a month they are running at$ 4.3 billion in ARR right now roughly 188 million paying users 1 million on the business plan which is like 60 bucks a month and at the end of the day that does not add up to anywhere close to what they need for their goals even with the gigantic like six billion and change or whatever that they raised from Venture Capital it's not close they need more and the only way that they can get more is to release models that allow them to charge more which is why I argued literally in a video an hour before this this whole thing released that Sam mman had a strategic imperative to release fast lo and behold he released fast and they must charge 200 bucks a month because they need iPhone level unit economics to pay for what they're building at the end of the day an iPhone costs people close to 200 bucks a month it just gets hidden in a phone plan now fancy iPhones consumers have choice they can go down Market I know all of that but just from a rough unit of value perspective 200 bucks is close to an iPhone payment it's close to a car plan it is not what you pay for software subscriptions and so they are breaking the category and they are suggesting implicitly that this will replace so much human labor for the researcher or for for the entrepreneur that it is worth that price point so they have to be betting on essentially tinder's business model tinder's business model is that like 1% of users are going to pay essentially anything for a date and so they just have prices that just keep stacking and going higher and higher and chat GPT knows that only like 1% of their users pay 60 Buck bucks now for the business plan less than that will pay 200 bucks even for a better model but they can charge those guys kind of anything they want right like the what is the entrepreneur going to pay for a model that allows him to delay hiring by six months or a year a whole lot more than 200 bucks a month if he has to and so there's a lot of elasticity in that upper sliver of their user base and I think that's part of their plan to monetize but they also if they want iPhone level cash flow do need to figure out how to get ordinary users who either are not paying on the free plan or are paying 20 bucks a month to convert over to this expensive plan on Moss right like as a bulk segment no one has figured that out yet they're not even trying with this release but I argue that their cash flow demands Apple level Apple level Revenue they are burning too much cash not to have it they need those kinds of unit economics to justify F 01 is out 0 Pro is out you have heard my little note on pricing and strategy let me know what you think of the new models
