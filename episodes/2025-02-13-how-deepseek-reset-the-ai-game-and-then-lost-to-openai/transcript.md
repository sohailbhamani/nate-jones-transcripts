# How DeepSeek Reset the AI Game and then Lost to OpenAI

so I've been thinking about Chad GPT 5 and I think my top takeaway is that deep seek won and they lost and I'm so I'm going to explain what I mean deep seek won by Shifting the entire window of conversation what we would call the Overton window toward free and transparent and more open source they lost because the bigger players in the space can afford to dig themselves a deep poll Cashwise to mimic what deep seek is doing for free and so what you see in the last few weeks really underlines how open AI is responding super aggressively to deep seek they've started to expose Chain of Thought and I know I know it's not the same as the private Chain of Thought on open AI I don't think most people care they've started to expose Chain of Thought they've moved to make their premium products somewhat more free so the latest one of those is deep research which is now going to be available on the free tier I think it's two uses a week and on the plus tier at 10 uses a week huge win and they are moving to make sure future product releases are also prioritizing free usage when Sam Alman laid out his chat GPT road map yesterday I talked about it here he said explicitly GPT 5 will be free unlimited chat now you may sit there as you know a technical person and say well what does that mean chat could mean a lot of things I agree with you chat could mean a lot of things it is possible that we will have to purchase the agent usage and the chat usage will be free it's possible the whole thing will be free and they'll make their money off of Corporations I'm not sure uh heck maybe maybe they'll have a closed model and like some of the conspiracy theories say they'll just make money off the stock market I don't know uh but the point is they are choosing to aggressively burn cash to make sure that they continue to compete on market share and thanks to SoftBank and the $40 billion deal that they're about to close with chat GPT they can afford to do that which means deep seek has changed the entire game so in the sense they won by resetting the rules but they lost because they lost the new game you reset the rules you showed the market values free and transparent and then you lost at that game now people will call out and I think it's true that deep seek in the US is not the same as deep seek globally and so deep seek can close deals in places where open AI is not going to ever be dominant like China uh or like Russia and they may well do that and that is going to give them the space to win in their own way so I don't want you to hear this and say deep seek has no way forward deep seek has no way to win but I do think it's relevant to observe that this is a classic business Str strategy case study where the Challenger brand changes the rules of the game by showing what's possible and then the dominant brand copies aspects of the Challenger brand that Ena them to win and crushes them because they have a dominant spot that's exactly what's happening with open Ai and deep seek right now in the US and frankly it's a master class uh and I don't say that because I think that open ey has no competition anymore or that the race is over or that I think everything Sam Alman does is great none of those things are true uh I do think it is an excellent example of business strategy essentially opena I had to respond quickly they did and as a result they have now positioned themselves within just a few weeks as the leader and the standard setting Setter in providing free usage of AI to everyone else and they've done it without product I want you to notice that Chad gp5 does not exist yet none of us have used it yet and it's still setting the terms of the debate and it's going to set the terms of the debate for others when Claude 4 which is rumored to be coming out shortly comes out everyone is going to immediately ask how does it compare to open AI in chat gp5 and that is deliberate that is deliberate and so now anthropic is going to have to look at their launch strategy look at their pricing look at their packaging relative to what Sam has publicly said he will do with GPT 5 and maybe change it up maybe make it more free and so deep seeks influence keeps being felt through the industry and I think that's super interesting so that's my take uh I wrote a lot more on the strategy behind this on substack if you want to check it out I'll link it in the description here I think at the end of the day to me the strategy of what chat GPT 5 is going to be is way way more interesting than the actual news like sure we all knew chat GPT 5 was coming it's coming in a few months whoopy do but the strategy behind that play is absolutely fascinating so I hope I gave you a little peek here feel free to look into the substack if you like a much deeper look at it uh I had fun I'm a strategy nerd so it's it's fun to talk about cheers
