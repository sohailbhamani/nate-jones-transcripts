# Stuck in the Chatbox? Here's When You Actually Need the API

Today we're going to address something that I have never seen addressed anywhere on the web and I cannot figure out why. We have a dime a dozen guides for using AI APIs. We have dime a dozen guides for using the chatbot. And you know what I cannot find anywhere? I cannot find a guide that helps you if you are a chatbot user and you are wondering what the heck is going on with these people using the API. And I'm I'm saying that because I think we have this implicit assumption still that developers use APIs and normal people don't. That's not true anymore. Especially after the launch of Chat GPT5 when it's possible to literally code up a whole front-end app in just a few minutes. What if you want to take that to the next level? What if you want to turn that into a real app? How do you start using the API? How do you know if you need to use it? How do you know if you might want to try using it? Because it's really not that scary. Especially, it's not that scary in an age when LLMs can help you use it. But still, nobody gives you a guide to know when you should use it and when you shouldn't and why you should be curious. That's what this video is for. Everyone will keep telling you use the API if you have a question that they can't answer in the chat box, but no one will explain why that's different. No one will explain how to get there. We're going to do it here. I'm going to assume you are paying 20 to $25 a month for something like Claude or Chatg GPT plus maybe you're on the free version. It works fine. Why are people acting like you're doing it wrong? That doesn't seem fair. Well, first off, you're not doing it wrong. The way we use a general purpose technology is what suits us to get the work done. And one thing I want you to hear is that this video is about giving you optionality. It's about giving you a set of tools that you didn't have before to make better decisions. And so much of the value we get out of AI is just making better decisions. And so that's what I want to do, lay out the technology. So the first thing to realize, the first fundamental misunderstanding that people who only use the chatbot tend to think is they think they are using the real product, the real product, quote unquote. If you're using Claude as a chatbot, if you're using chat GPT as a chatbot, you think you're using the real product. Now, putting on my product manager hat for a second, you could argue that you are, right? Because if most people in the world are using the product, you can kind of say, well, by default, it must be the real thing. But the reason I say you're not actually using the real product, is that the chatbot is an intentionally limited demo. I'm going to say it again. The chatbot is an intentionally limited demo that is designed to be just good enough to hook you in. That is actually what chat GPT was trying to do when they released the original Chat GPT that went viral. They were they were releasing an intentionally limited demo. They never thought it would get as big as it did. And now they're stuck with this worldwide product on their hands that was meant to be a demo. As an example of what I mean by demo, reasoning mode in chat GPT5. Everyone thinks, well, you have three levels, right? You have chat JPG5 Pro, you have thinking mode, and you have fast mode, and people have their opinions about those, etc. We're not going to go into that. I've covered that elsewhere. What they don't realize is those are preset levels that just are there for demoing the possibilities. You can actually go and set reasoning efforts in the API and you can get more power than you could even get in Chad JPT5 Pro in the API. It's a good example of how the API tends to give you more of a paint palette for what you want to do. It's like having a set of power tools instead of just hand tools. If you know what you're doing, you can get a lot more done. And because documentation is so clean and so useful now and so readable by LLMs, even if you've never done it before, yes, you can use the API. You can another example Gemini gives you a different number of tokens in the web interface than they do in the API. Another example, chat GPT preserves state in the API, remembers past conversation and reasoning traces in the API in a way it doesn't in the chatbot. These are different products. You can tune what's called the temperature of the model in the API in a way that you cannot in the chatbot. So temperature is a way of measuring the creativity of the model. In the chatbot, Chad GPT just selects what it thinks the public wants and gives you that and there's no way to change it. You are not getting the full model capabilities that you are paying for. You're getting the safe for the general public version of the AI. And that's the first thing I want to clear up is people think these are the same product and anyone who has used a model in the API will tell you it feels like a different model. I also want to call out that the the cost comparison is not obvious to people, but it's really important to get right. You can actually spend less money in the API depending on what you need than you would spend for just $20 a month on the chatbot. It turns out if you're not using an expensive reasoning model, 20 bucks gets you a real real long ways. These are cheap, cheap, cheap cheap turns, especially for the smaller GPT5 models, especially for Gemini. Gemini is really cheap. One of the reasons why people in production applications use the API is because you can closely meter how much it costs. And it turns out when you're not paying a blanket price that some CFO has worked out that explains the overall average usage cost for all users kind of aggregated out. No, you just pay for what you get. It's like a toll road. You you you pay the meter and you use the road. That's how it works. It's very simple. It's very transparent. Another example of the utility. You can actually get using that features like that extended context window. You can get more work done in the API. This is going to depend on you. If you're just doing recipes with Chad GPT and you're perfectly happy, honestly, you're probably not watching anymore. Let's just let's just be honest. But if you want to do something that has a larger piece of work, let's say you want to work with Claude in the million token context window, that's going to be much more useful in the API. You got to work with the API so that you can effectively load in the context. And by the way, the API is how you more finely control the context in the prompt. If you're in the chatbot, there's a system prompt there that you just cannot get past. That is the first thing the chatbot sees. You've got more control in the API over what you make the system prompt. Again, more control, more tools, power tools, not hand tools. That's the metaphor I want you to keep in mind. One of the things that you are going to find out is that you want, if you're at all serious about work, you want your chatbot to plug in better to other parts of your workflow. You want to not just spend your day copying and pasting. This is where agents come in. They promise to take data from X and put it into Y. But you know what? A lot of people have gotten into APIs just to write integrations that let them put the LLM and the intelligence where they want it. I know people who have configured Obsidian, a note-taking app, so they can put LLMs where they want it in their notes, and they use the API for that. One of the things that Claude has done a really good job of is it's democratized access to tools through the model context protocol called MCP. And MCP servers let you call tools with your LLM and do all sorts of things. It's not very easy to do MCP calls in chat bots. It's barely possible in claude right now. It's so much easier in the API. It's so much easier in the API. In a sense, one of the things I am observing is that very old assumptions about code are scaring people and keeping them from actually accessing a way of working with AI that is in many ways easier than the chatbot. We get nervous around a terminal. We get nervous around code. I get it. We now have worldclass coding teachers on hand and they're getting better and better at teaching. In fact, Anthropic released an entire teaching mode for Claude Code just this week. Wow, that's really cool. Or maybe it was this past week. And so, it's easier and easier to use these APIs. Now, all of that being said, there are cases where maybe you don't need the API, right? If you are only using AI for brainstorming, if you're only using it for casual questions, if your biggest integration is, can you search the web for me? I don't want to sit here and pretend the API is going to be a breakthrough for you. I don't think that's it. If you love the back and forth conversational format rather than asking the LLM to do work and come back to you, the API may not be for you, and that's entirely fine. The whole purpose of this video is to let you make an informed decision. We all get to use this tool the way we want. I just don't want you to be scared of the API. So, what does an actual transition into API using look like? It's it's one of those things where one one day if you're doing work and you're using chat GPT or you're using clutter using Gemini more and more maybe you're using Grock you're going to hit a wall and you're going to hit that wall of frustration where you have tried something over and over again and you just are so frustrated. That's the moment I want you to remember this video. Let's say you've really really tried to get the tone right and you just can't and you want more configurability over the tone. Let's say you've tried reasoning and you don't have enough reasoning power. Or let's say you've tried to load a big piece of context and it's just not working. You need the API. You need the API. And that's okay because the API is there when it's ready. The API is going to give you great options. And look, I would not suggest if I were you that you switch models when you move to the API. Whatever you're currently using, you're using Chad JPT, use the Chad JPT API. You're using Cloud, use the Cloud API. Don't make it complicated. These are all fine. The thing to call out is that you will immediately have so many more options. And I'm going to give you as a review five of them that we've talked about briefly before, but I want to kind of underline them so you actually see what the API can do and you can make the call for yourself. Number one is function calling. That means the AI can trigger actions, not just generate text. Number two, structured outputs. Enable the AI to absolutely every time respond in JSON, respond in tables, respond in whatever format you want, every single time. Have system prompts that work. Number three, web interface system prompts are suggestions. API system prompts are more like the law. Number four, streaming responses. You can get words generated as they're generated. You don't have to wait for complete responses. Batch processing. You can send a thousand prompts at once and get responses overnight if you're willing to wait. There's all kinds of cool stuff you can do. And it's cheaper. It's cheaper unless you're using really expensive reasoning tokens, but even then it's not that expensive. Paying for what you use. It could be five bucks. It could be 500 bucks. And that can feel risky to people. But you can set budgets and it won't go past the budget. Like you can control that so it doesn't feel like it's too risky. Here's why this decision matters to you. It's not just about the tasks in front of you. The web interface is training you to think in chat format, question, answer, followup. The API trains you to think in workflows input process output and then integrate. The latter is more powerful. The latter lets you get more done. And that is why I want you to know what it feels like to use the API if you've never done it. Staying too long in the web interface if you have dreams of doing real work limits your imagination about what is possible. And that matters. matters to me. I want you to have the tools to make better choices. Moving to the API when you feel like you have to because it's trendy because Nate said so is also a bad idea. I'm not here to make you move to the API. I don't want you to waste time on complexity you don't need. And that's why I called out examples of uses that don't need it. If you're just searching the web, if you're just having conversations back and forth and you feel great about that, you don't feel a need for more work, do not use the API. Use this video as an excuse. The right transition time is when you face the interface friction that I described. I gave you some really tangible pain points I've seen. Recognize those pain points are not the fault of the AI. Those pain points are the fault of the demo interface you're engaged with. You can have better AI and you deserve it. So there you go. If you are asking, should I use the API? This is the this is the answer. If if if you are worried you can't use the API, this is my encouragement that you can. If you want a way to get started, this is how you do it. It's very simple. You go to your current chatbot and you say, "I want to learn to use the API. I've never done it. Give me step-by-step instructions. Please use current documentation. Please search the web and check your sources before you answer." That last bit is really important because LLMs tend to default to training data from their cutoff date, which is often early and out-of-date LLM documentation. So, make sure it searches the web, make sure that it finds the current documentation, and then have it explain it to you. Have it explain how to get started. And I would say if you have a point of frustration, be honest with your AI about the point of frustration and ask it how the API can help you. It can actually help you figure out how to bridge from your individual unique point of frustration to a world where the API can help you solve it. If you're not sure, if you're like, I'm frustrated, maybe this is what Nate is meaning. Ask the AI about it. The API is not that scary. That's why this video exists. If you're a developer and you've watched this whole darn thing, you know what's here for you. This is a tool. This video is a tool. This talk track is a tool that you can use to make your work less complicated and confusing to people. This is how you explain why APIs matter to people who don't get it. APIs give you power tools for AI and that and that's really important in a world where we want to get real work done. So there you go. This is your reason. This is your this is your video to determine whether you need the API. And if you do, that's how you get started. Cheers.
