# Managers Are Nuking Your Career: Pay $300-$2000 a Month or Get Left Behind

managers are screwing the AI revolution. And I say that as someone who has managed teams and I have great sympathy for the challenges that we're all experiencing right now, but it's true. It's true. And I'm going to I'm going to be really honest. I have talked to a lot of individual contributors and the universal complaint I hear near universal 99% 98% is that they want access to AI tools that will help them do their job better in a really significant way. Like we're talking in some cases for your best performers double or triple their productivity and they can't get it. And they can't get it because the managers are not budgeting for it. And managers will tell me well we can't go to it. It is giving difficulties about security going back up to department heads. Like my boss is just not going to like go for 400 bucks a month per employee. They've never seen that. Managers, senior managers, directors, you guys carry the flag on this. You have to be the ones that explain clearly to your bosses, to the IT department, why we don't live in a traditional software world anymore. We do not live in a world where getting access to a regular sort of software product is a minor help and a minor inconvenience if you don't get it right. It's not a big deal either way. Maybe it costs 25 bucks a seed for the year. Maybe it costs a h 100red bucks a seed for the year and you forget about it. No, we live in a world where people who are extraordinary at AI can effectively double or triple their productivity if they have access to the right tools. You can literally buy the productivity off the shelf. And yes, it is more expensive than traditional software. It is two or three hund bucks a month. And you may be thinking to yourself as a manager, I'll kick this down the road. I'll get it next fiscal year. I've got news for you. It's not going to get cheaper. And the reason why is we are now baselining against people compensation. So you think 300 400 bucks a month is expensive. Sure it's expensive. Is it as expensive as a person doing that job? No. No it is not. It is vastly cheaper. There is a lot of headroom there for model makers to build more effective tools that will go from two or 3xing your employees productivity to 5 or 10xing it and they will charge more. Soon you're going to be looking at software costs maybe by 2026, by 2027 that are running a,000, $2,000 a month per employee. And IT departments aren't ready for that. Leadership isn't ready for that. But it is critical that we have the conversations now because otherwise there are going to be a few companies that figure that out. Figure out that their own aged legacy processes are getting in the way of actually helping their employees to do better at their work. and they'll kick the processes aside, which is what you should do, and they will figure out a way to get it done. This is the same incentive set problem that frustrates existing employees when they see new hires coming in at a higher comp band, which is a notorious problem across the industry. People care more about getting the new hire in the door than about keeping the legacy hire because the incentive is to make sure that that new hire in that moment walks in and fills that role. Whereas the incentive for the existing employee is just can they come in tomorrow. It just isn't the same. We have the same problem with software. The incentive is can we just keep our existing process? Can we just have them come in tomorrow? Can we just have them do the work? And people are thinking of it like a mechanical horse. So in the old days when we had the car, we did not know what cars were capable of, right? We thought that cars were capable of things that horses were capable of. It was the mechanical horse. It was literally called that. That was our mental model. We have the same problem now with software. It is the mechanical horse problem. And we think of AI software as if it is software. It is not. We need to have a new category for it. And I realize that this makes me sound annoyingly like an onhype on trend AI agent. I don't know influencer. It's not. The point is not to say agent for the sake of agent. The point is not to invent a category because we need a category because we need to hype things. The point is just that the old category doesn't fit anymore. Traditional software just isn't priced like this. Traditional software doesn't deliver productivity gains like this. And so if you were going through traditional software budgeting and planning processes, it's not going to work, is it? You're going to go through and like every other department head is going to sit there and be like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're doing our regular basic like 100 bucks a month or 200 bucks a month total for our employees for software and professional development." And then we're done, right? Moving on. And you're going to sit there as the forward thinking guy where wherever you are, right? Or gal or whatever in whatever department you happen to be. Maybe you're in product, maybe you're in engineering, and you're going to be like, "Well, we're going to be budgeting 2,000 bucks a month per employee." No, that doesn't include professional development. We actually going to budget another 2,000 bucks a month to make sure they get the AI courses they need to supercharge them. And that's what we're going to do. Doesn't that sound great? And you're going to get laughed out of the room because nobody else at your level in your business is doing that. And so this becomes a problem of the commons. Basically, everyone is incentivized to look in the budgeting process for leadership. And so, nobody is incentivized to be bold and say, "I could deliver extraordinary value if you can shift my budgeting." But that is what we need. And employees are going to vote with their feet here because the really good ones are going to move to roles and to businesses that get this and they will not stay with you. They won't they won't stay with you. best employees at AI will go to the companies that understand this. This is not just a matter of Mark Zuckerberg broke the market with $100 million compensation. No, this is actually I mean for one, people left Meta after that. People walked away from the $und00 million compensation, right? They went back to their old jobs cuz they didn't like Meta. So no, it's not about the money. It's about your ability as a business to generate a culture change that enables your best people to feel like they can thrive with AI. Because if you look at it from the point of view of an individual contributor, it has never been more challenging to figure out a career path. You have to figure out how are you going to supercharge your AI skills? How are you going to deliver in your current role? How do you set up your resume so it looks good in a world where roles are changing and mixing and merging all the time? And to do that, you desperately need access to AI tooling so that you can show your next role or your existing role when you get a promotion that you know how to use it. And by and large, our businesses are not setting employees up for success on that. And I do think that comes back to senior managers and directors. We have to have more advocacy for our teams. They need that for their own careers. They need that to deliver for the business. And if you look at it from a managerial perspective, you need that in order to grow your own career. Your teams need to be that successful. We are going to live in a world more and more where leadership at the best companies is going to expect you not to grow your headcount. Instead, expect you to prove that you have done everything with AI that you possibly can to expand the impact of your team as it is today. And what we need is not just that expectation, but a corresponding investment in the team, a corresponding willingness to say if we want to grow that impact, it's not just a 20 buck a month chat GPT subscription anymore. That was 2023. Sorry, they now do so much more. And I think that is one of the hardest things to convey to leadership is that even though the name is still chat GPT, we have gone in two years from a little chatbot to a agent capable of doing hours of work. And that's not the same thing at all. It's not remotely the same thing. It is a weird world that we live in that we name it the same thing. We call it AI. Do you does your team have AI? Right? It should be 20 bucks a month. It's AI, right? Get the co-pilot. It's AI. AI is not AI. These are not onetoone comparisons. This does not work this way. And so it is on senior managers and directors to sit down with teams to explain in detail what they need. And so teams need to explain and voice to managers. These are the tools I need. And managers need to explain and voice really clearly and advocate for their teams for this use case, for product, for engineering, for marketing, for customer success. This is what my teams need to be extraordinarily productive in 2025. It will cost. It will cost more than traditional software, but you'd rather pay it than a lose your best people or b flo bloat your headcount budget because increasingly it is looking less in most cases like firing people unless they don't want to do AI and it's looking more like we're just not going to grow the team as fast because we have so much leverage from AI. Well, if your team is wanting to lean in, that's fantastic. They have the domain knowledge. They want to lean in. Let's get them the budget so that they can actually deliver for the business. And overwhelmingly I hear from people that that is not happening. I see that that is not happening. Very few businesses are sitting there and saying our software procurement has to change. Our budgeting has to change. But it does. It has to shift. It is not acceptable to expect your AI employees to do 2025 AI work on a 2023 budget. It doesn't work. Traditional software budgets are broken. So, if you are in that spot, send this video to your manager. Tell your manager, "Watch this. This is a problem for us. I can't get the budgeting I need to do my work." And if you're in leadership, this has got to be a call to action for you. You cannot look at traditional software budgeting the same way. This is not traditional software. I don't care if you call it agentic software. I don't care what the hype term is, but you've got to shift the way you budget for work and you've got to invest in your best employees so they can deliver this 2, three, four, 5x impact over the next couple years. So that is my challenge to you. We are we are not in old software land anymore. We are in new software land and there are new rules and there are new budgets and you have to invest in your team at a different level. Good luck.
