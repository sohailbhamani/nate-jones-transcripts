# Cursor AI: 6 Apps Built with Cursor + Strategy Question for Builders

what are people actually building with the AI Cod assist cursor I found six different examples I'm going to go through them briefly here and then I want to actually step back and ask what we can learn from looking across the ecosystem about what cursor is good at what it's not good at what we haven't seen yet and I think that will help us answer some of the larger questions that come to mind like is cursor good for complex apps is cursor good for large code bases things like that so example number one uh this is from one little coder I'm going to put all of these in the YouTube comments uh weather app can we write a weather app in JavaScript and get it runnable very simple uh and it's exactly what it says in the tin can you basically pull publicly available weather data turn it into a nice graphical user interface uh all about AI the creator has a YouTube Tech search app it looks simple but I do appreciate the functionality here it basically allows you to pull a video and do a text search through the video uh because it pulls all of the transcript down and you can actually search through and you can get a time stamp for particular things you're looking for so if you're going through and you're trying to understand like where does this person talk about X or Y you can just search for the word and find it really fast Riley Brown uh is building a following just talking about his journey as someone who doesn't code but is coding using llm so that's his whole thing and he uh talked about cursor in the context of building a Trello app CopyCat um looks pretty simple to me uh but I will definitely link it in you can look at it uh a simple chatbot uh the interesting thing here uh the Creator Ricky had uh is teaching his kid to code and the kid built the chatbot herself and she's eight uh which as someone with a kid very impressive my kid has not yet built a chatbot um and then Amar who's a designer at 11 Labs took the weekend this past weekend and built a Mac app fully functional that's designed to solve for importing voice into video and that's like he's a Creator like it makes sense for him to do that and I was impressed I mean maybe we shouldn't be surprised he's head of design it looks gorgeous like it's a really well-designed app it looks the most polished of any of these that I've SC um and then the last one I want to call out is uh chantastic is writing about or doing a video on cursor and python so if you're wondering how does cursor help you build in Python for AI use cases there's a video for that too so those are six different use cases again I'll link them all below I want to step back though when you see the pattern here I think you won't be surprised when I call out that most of these are really really simple use cases and and I have three different hypotheses for why that might be true one is the context window the context window right now is 20,000 tokens on cursor is it because the context window is short uh well not short right that's still dozens of pages but is it short enough that it's an issue for larger code bases maybe is it that it is simple because people are rushing to production want to show what they've built there's this sort of Creator urge to get out there and show you can push to production and people aren't really thinking through more complex use cases yet maybe is it because the lack of design thinking leads people to solve really simple pinpoint problems that are useful to them but maybe not more fundamental and may not require a larger build and that one kind of cuts both ways because a lot of the advice for MVPs is to build it simple build for a paino that you know really well so in a sense cursor enabling people to act on that general advice for sort of how you get into software how you get into building things that are useful I'm not sure which it is uh cursor has ways of handling context windows that sort of stretch around uh the 20,000 limit sometimes they don't really talk about that uh very much I wasn't able to find out a lot about it other than that they apparently have some proprietary methods of doing so I think the design thinking is something I'm taking away I think it's going to be increasingly important if software costs come down to be really thoughtful about what you want to build how you want it to look and why to stand out and so in that sense I think a Mars app uh really shows the way that you can you can build something with an llm even if you don't know how to code and you can make it look really nice you can make it look really polished and that's going to become increasingly important in order to justify the value of your software in a world where anyone and everyone is coding up web apps at the drop of a hat which is the other big take way here like if an 8-year-old is coding a chat app software is essentially free for anyone to produce so all that being said I'm curious what your take is where what patterns do you see in this list of use cases I found are there use cases that I miss that people are building in how do you see cursor playing into the larger llm ecosystem
