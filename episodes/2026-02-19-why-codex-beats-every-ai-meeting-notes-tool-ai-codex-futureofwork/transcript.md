# Why Codex beats every AI meeting notes tool #ai #codex #futureofwork

It is a different operating model and it takes some getting used to. Now, this is the part most coverage misses. I use codecs for things that have nothing to do with software development. When I come out of a three-hour meeting with a super dense transcript, multiple threads of conversation, no tagged speakers, action items buried in tangents, decisions made in the last 5 minutes, but but nobody remembered to write them down. I just dump that full transcript at Codeex and I ask it for a clean scannable HTML page that captures the meeting in a way that people will actually read. Key decisions at the top, open questions flagged, action items pulled out with owners and deadlines. The whole tangled mess of a long conversation organized into something useful. And it does it. It handles hours and hours and hours of content without losing the thread at all. Because the same architecture that lets it sustain 7 hours or days of autonomous coding lets it sustain deep analysis of long complicated documents really really easily.
