# NEW from OpenAI: The Swarm is coming

with all the fears around Ai and what it could do to us and our jobs and Skynet worries Etc you would think that AI companies would go out of their way to name their AI products something calming and peaceful but no uh in this case open AI decided to name their new multi-agent API swarm because a swarm of bees sounds peaceful and restful I guess I don't know so the idea behind swarm is that essentially you can create a team of Agents to accomplish a task I'm going to give you a specific example just so you kind of get a sense this is not the only one in the space either so let's say I'm trying to query the weather so I type into my llm of choice hello what's the weather today now if I'm doing that into an application that uses a swarm API what can happen is that the manager agent which could be an llm like cat gp40 interprets the English query and then decides this is a weather request and delegates it to a rules-based agent so it's not an llm at that point it's just it's just uh deterministic it just takes inputs and produces outputs like a traditional computer program and it gives it to the weather agent and says weather agent go query the weather for the IP address associated with this laptop weather agent reads the IP address on the laptop goes and queries the local weather using an API and returns uh probably a Json file they then hand the Json back to the manager and say hey here's the Json and the manager llm reads the Json and reinterprets it into plain English and says the weather outside is 60 degrees and raining and perhaps it adds something snarky like you live in Seattle what did you expect so when I look at that that sounds really easy it's certainly not something that is only available through open AI right now but it signals a strategic shift that openai has been kind of flagging for a few months now they are not going to be just satisfied with building an llm they want to build the operating system for artificial intelligence going forward and that means building these kinds of approaches that enable an llm to interact with other aspects of compute to deliver real-time answers to things that users care about and so this is right in line with that ecosystem play if you want to build a multi-agent approach right now and don't want to name it swarm there are other approaches available crew AI is more sophisticated it's used for things like multi- chatbot conversations right now so it's not like open AI is the only game in town but the fact that they are choosing to play here suggests that they are continuing to invest in creating the operating system layer on which they want everybody to be building and so I would expect more API to drop I would expect more functionality for developers and that if you're thinking about sort of competition between different big companies that is a direct shot at Mark Zuckerberg and the play he's making with the Llama ecosystem Mark has invested a lot in making llama really really easy for developers to work with and he's been pretty public about that one of the things he's called out is that at the end of the day he doesn't need the large language model to be priced to be effective he can give away the intelligence because he can monetize it in the way he leverages llms for his algorithm personalized content Etc but what he does need is for people to be developing using his llm so that the ecosystem for meta gets richer over time which in turn adds value to Consumers on meta's platform over time that's what he needs and so he needs a living EOS system for llama long term and open AI is essentially saying the ecosystem is the game and we're going to play too and so they're going to be working hard to make sure there are more and more tools more and more simple uh get started quick options for developers who want to build in the space and I would expect that some of the things that we've had to do where we've had to have you know rag approaches tool chain approaches Etc you can see with these releas reles open AI is chipping away at that larger context Windows chip away at it having uh the Swarm API chips away at it fundamentally they want to bring the process of uh enabling these llm agents enabling this intelligence in your toolchain entirely onto their systems so that they can capture more of that value so they can be the operating system that the intelligence of the future runs on we'll see how successful they are but that's the play and I think we saw little signal for it with swarm what have you been building with swarm hopefully it's not dystopian cheers
