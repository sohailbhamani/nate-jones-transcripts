# OpenAI Dev Day: 4 Takeaways

open AI had their Dev day yesterday and I want to call out four takeaways I thought were significant and I also want to talk about where this is hinting that we're going in 20125 so takeaways first number one they are making intelligence cheaper they're dropping API costs by 50% on the basis of having seen these tokens before and so now they can process them more cheaply and so they're passing the costs on to the developers anthropic immediately followed and also dropped cost 50% this is not a surprised face over here intelligence is getting cheaper in fact we've never lived in a world where intelligence has gotten cheaper and better at the same time and that's what we're living in right now it's a wild world second thing I want to call out is we are launching an we are getting a hold of as developers a real-time API with voice to voice so this means it's possible for anyone to build an app that for example does customer success phone calls an app that calls up your phone carrier and demands cheaper rates an app that calls up the moving company to arrange a move whatever it is you want like it's easy to build an app for that and openai clearly expects a lot of action from their 3 million plus developers on that API they're raising token limits they're going to make it possible to put 10,000 tokens a minute through these apis and they're expecting you to use the voice one by the hour like they priced it out so it's a reasonable price per hour 18 bucks an hour for someone to talk on the phone it competes with labor costs and that's exactly where they're positioning it okay and that's not the only thing that they that they did they also previewed intelligence so I said intelligence was getting better they previewed the 01 model by the way I don't mean 01 preview the model that's on all all of our apps I mean they previewed the actual 01 model I know words are hard so the actual 01 model they used it to program a drone live on stage the Drone flew around it shot video Etc and they did it all like from setting up the server to Flying the Drone right there by working with 01 and that sort of gets me to like so those are the big takeaways right so we have the realtime API we have the o1 we have apis getting cheaper um and they're also making it easier to fine-tune these models so like middleware providers that like lived off of fine-tuning apis may be somewhat in trouble because they're going to give you the tools to fine-tune apis and do smaller application specific models right off of the open AI sort of API level so basically you don't have to go to someone else to tune your model for you necessarily depending on your application you can go straight to open AI for take but here's the thing like if at the larger scale the model's getting smarter with 01 the model's getting cheaper cheaper tokens affordable voice calling rates for an hour it's getting more capable with the fine-tuning with the voice too realtime API higher token limits it's pointing the direction to agent-based workflows that's the takeaway for me like we are seeing the shape of what agent-based workflows are going to look like and that's actually what Sam also hinted when he talked about the future he said said he thinks agent-based workflows are coming next year and that it will be as big a moment for the world as the launch of the original chat GPT because think about it you give a task to the agent you go to bed the agent is done with it by morning and you have I don't know a working piece of software some large project that you want done and it's just completely finished so it's really going to change our expectations for productivity I'm sure it's going to change their pricing model I don't expect that to come cheap and it's going to change how we think about how humans interact with this kind of intelligence and the kinds of problems we solve there's going to be even more fear uncertainty and doubt in the labor market around how these agents can work as employees versus now but I don't view it as an apocalypse for jobs I actually think that these agents will be additive I think that they're going to help humans solve problems for humans and I think net net we're going to be able to work in partnership with intelligence like this to solve meaningful problems I think that's the most likely outcome it's not the only possibility like there's other possibilities out there that are that are darker for sure but looking at how ragged edged the adoption is already for chat GPT looking at how two-thirds of American workers still don't use chat GPT daily or weekly there's there's so much left room to run room to run just on adoption right and you add agents to the workflow and and there will be that same adoption curve layered on top of agent based workflows I see the pictures of the future through this Dev day but I also think it is going to arrive in fits and starts it's going to arrive in pieces for individual people and there will be lots of room to adapt if you're hungry to adapt um and as part of why I'm doing my Maven courses I think there is opportunity to adapt I don't view this as a job's Apocalypse at all one last takeaway I think this timing is really interesting with the raise that they're doing so Sam is doing a$6 a half billion dollar raise terms leaked out today that are sweeter than the original terms and I think that's influenced by the departure of technical Talent like mea Mora um and they need to be able to convince investors that they can do this and that the investors have some protection and not surprising the terms that leaked offer more protection to investors they offer an interest rate to investors they offer a clawback option Etc um and so basically investors are going to get some guarantees if Sam has trou converting this to a for-profit entity and getting the technical Talent on board to really make a run at this AGI goal that they have right artificial general intelligence we will see my suspicion is that if he can successfully raise six and a half billion he will be able to scare up the technical Talent he needs to because he'll have the salaries to command but the best people in the world are also very very scarce in this field and they many of them are already Founders and so it may look like a bunch of Aqua hires um we'll have to see I think that's one of the really interesting questions coming out of this is that the Ambitions of the company are clear it's unclear if the technical Talent they have on board with mea's departure and a few other departures is enough to get them there or if they have a talent problem that they're going to need to close uh and that's something that I'm going to be keeping my eye on we'll see maybe agent based work closer coming next year
