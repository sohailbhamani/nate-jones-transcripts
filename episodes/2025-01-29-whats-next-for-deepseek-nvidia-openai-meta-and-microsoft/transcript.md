# What's next for DeepSeek, NVIDIA, OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft

here's my prediction of what happens next on deep seek on Nvidia on this whole situation where we have a massively efficient model disrupting the market number one I expect as a strategic play deep seek to attempt to bring free very close to copy products to market across the entire open AI product surface area and I don't say close to copy because I'm saying they're just copying everything they do and they all they can do is copycat this is an Innovative team they've brought efficient things to Market I say copy because their deliberate strategy is to displace the market share that open AI has established with consumers and developers that's the play also with developers versus anthropic because Sonet is absolutely threatened by coding with deep seek so the play is bring operator to Market an operator clone whatever deep seek has that is like operator the play is bring a voice clone to Market where you have like advanced voice mode and these are all by the way going to be free and because they are free there are going to be millions of people who try something like operator for the first time not with open AI but with deep seek that is brilliant they are absolutely burning cash to do stuff like this and it is worth it to them if they can gain market share back they're going to release a video tool probably something that is designed to compete with Sora that may take them a little bit longer but I guarantee you they're working on it so they're going to go across the whole product Suite it will be relentless and now that the media has a narrative that deep seek driving releases means bad things for American companies there will just be this constant drip of news about it and deep seek is smart they will keep that constant drip of news going it helps them to gain mind share it helps them to gain market share okay so what happens to Nvidia what happens to the other players they will keep spending on chips and you know why because of Game Theory and that's not just me saying that by the way if you think oh Nate is sitting here saying oh it's Game Theory no Mark Zuckerberg has said I think about Game Theory all the time with AI it's not just me and Mark Zuckerberg by the way has a lot more billions than I do to spend on this Mark Zuckerberg announced 60 to 65 billion in net AI investment for this year his goal is to have an autonomous software engineer he's building a data center that is half the size of Manhattan all of that was announced after deep seek do you think he didn't know about it he did know about it and the fact that he has apparently reportedly four different continuously running War rooms to go after like what deep seek dig did and how to bring it into llama that's fine that's just Zuck in founder mode he'll figure it out he's not going to spend less and the reason why he won't spend less is very very simple the prize value that these companies ascribe to artificial general intelligence and after that artificial super intelligence is so high they will pay anything just to be in the game so it is rational to spend more and more and more so that you stay in the game because all of your competitors are spending more what happens if you are the person who says Ah deep seek lets me spend less and you wind back your investment from $60 billion to20 billion and your competitors even one of them says I'm taking the other side of that bet I'm going to spend more and they win catastrophic for that company met meta immediately out of the AI race they lose out on from these CEOs perspective potentially trillions of dollars in gains they will not risk that kind of disaster they will spend more to make sure they are in the game they will overspend to make sure they are in the game and Nvidia will continue to benefit and if you think only American CEOs are playing game theory I have a I have news for you there is a reason that China has announced a 128 billion package for AI if they really just trained this entire model on $5.5 million you'd think why would they invest another $128 billion or $38 billion the numbers vary on AI well because they also want to be in the game and they will spend a lot to get there it's pretty simple and so I think game theory has not gone away the advantages of artificial general intelligence have not gone away and the incentives all of these players face have not gone away and neither has the strategy that deep seek has to gain market share and it's a great strategy by the way and so I would expect that we are going to see more deep seek releases very soon I expect them to be free I expect them to be eye-opening and pretty good and I think they're going to put pressure on the business models that especially open AI has adopted where they're able to go to Consumers and get Mass payments from consumers I don't know if that sustainable if deep seek is willing to just give them free compute for a while someone's subsidizing that compute but they're giving it away for free for now to gain market share and it is working so we're going to have to see we're going to have to see what do you think is going to happen next
