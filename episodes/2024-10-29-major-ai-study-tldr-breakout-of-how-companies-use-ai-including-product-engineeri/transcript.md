# Major AI Study TLDR: Breakout of how companies use AI, including product, engineering, marketing etc

it is really important that we update our priors update our assumptions about generative AI regularly as the data warrants in this case it's a big deal we have a giant jump in weekly usage of AI reported by Wharton business school they did a longitudinal study of the same people from 23 and 24 and what they came back with is a jump from 37% usage once a week last year in 2023 to to 72% usage once a week this year these people are uh leading departments at businesses ranging from $50 million in size all the way up past two billion and so they got to get a sense of the department level usage for these generative AI tools and what you see is that same doubling pattern repeated across the board purchasing and procurement 50% usage last year 99 no 94% usage this year 94 still stuning uh product and Engineering 40% usage last year up to 78% usage this year management up from 26 to 69% this year marketing up from 20 to 62% this year it's a really consistent lift across the board and we probably should update our Baseline assumptions around how many people are using AI at work the starter Assumption of it being a third is probably inaccurate at this point is probably closer to 2/3 now you might be wondering do these two-thirds of people have controls can they just do whatever they want well anecdotally I've been hearing that they can just do whatever they want and half of orgs report that roughly and that is more distributed towards smaller businesses larger businesses tend to have controls which is what I've heard as well so that one's not too much of a surprise one of the things that that is interesting to me is that I see that the adoption and usage is actually led by smaller businesses this time so businesses uh between $50 million and uh on up toward a billion dollars are 80% usage that I I'm a little bit surprised but like basically they they cross tabed they cut the average usage once a week and they said well how does that split out by business size and businesses that are smaller are at 80% usage and businesses that are that are much larger that are in the Enterprise range above $2 billion they have lower usage rates and that comes back through in the number of permissions required to use generative AI like you see that if you are an Enterprise it is actually much less likely that you can use AI with no restrictions uh and in fact roughly 3/4 of people at larger businesses above $2 billion report substantial restrictions on their ability to use Ai and so what's my takea away from all this well the first place I go and look I I I'm not too surprised that you are just growing the top line numbers ey popping doubling in a year is a lot uh we never really saw that with uh internet with email like we didn't have this kind of growth even though it was really exciting growth but I look at the activities what are people actually spending their time doing with generative Ai and that's sort of where I go for understanding what's happening and most people are doing pretty basic stuff so document editing 64% a little bit of analysis 62% and summarizing documents 59% these are ABC use cases for generative AI they're not super fancy and that means that there's a lot of room left for the larger corporations for smaller corporations to figure out that generative AI can do a whole lot more for them than just edit their docs and I don't think people necessarily know that and I think one of the things that this study doesn't get at effectively is how do you measure adoption of more complex workflows or building you know tool chains that enable larger and uh more complicated work to be done the other thing that this study doesn't really get at is to what extent these organizations are building AI Solutions into their product and I think that's deliberate and I think the reason it's deliberate is because their study is Broad and in many cases if you are making bolts if you are making uh rug Cutters if you are making anything that's physical it's not necessarily going to be wrapped into your product and if you want a wider survey of Business Leaders you're going to have to wrap in folks beyond the software business and so if you're doing that it doesn't really make sense to say hey generative AI are you building generative AI into your latest rug rug cutter right like that's that's not going to happen Okay but they're still just using this for simple things and to me that represents a opportunity for people to help folks understand what is in the box when it comes to Ai and how big that space is and how much there is uh that you can build and unlock what's interesting is leaders recognize that training is needed one of the things that they said they would substantially increase investment in was training their teams for generative AI but I think one of the challenges is that they don't really yet know what to train in if you dig into the cross tabs there's not really an understanding of what generative AI training should include and I think that's a big opportunity for Consultants I think it's a big opportunity to set the table and say this is what's needed for generative AI fluency um and I think it's one of the things that I will be really curious to see if they do the survey again next year because I would expect the sophistication of usage to go up uh I would expect more complicated uh workflows to be mentioned more frequently and I would expect that uh generative AI training would be something that people understand better like glad people are enthusiastic I'm glad they want a budget for it don't get me wrong but we need to know what we're asking for we need to know what we're training to to be effective and I think that's really shown one last takeaway 90% of firms are leading AI internally and that's really split half of them are saying they're leading AI with multiple teams half with one team but the Consultants are not leading the AI strategy here and that's something that's really really clear when you look through the report the Consultants just are uh there to help there to assist but not necessarily there to take the lead organizations seem to view it as really important that they own this uh and half of the ones surveyed have a chief AI officer so that is a real job title I'd wondered how much of a real job title it was but based on self reports it's a real job title and it's growing quickly so we're going to see probably AI departments as as well is something that I would expect and that's an interesting job family shift we will see all right that is the Wharton study I will link it here in the YouTube I think it's worth a look because I want it to update my thinking I want it to update your thinking on where AI actually is at in businesses because it shapes how we build software it shapes how we think about the products we launch it shapes how we understand who we would expect to know about AI versus who we would not expect to know about I okay there you go Wharton study I'll link it
