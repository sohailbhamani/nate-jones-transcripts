# AI Coding Tool Comparison: The TLDR on Replit, Cursor, Pythagora, and Bolt

I dug through hours and hours of YouTube videos I read a bunch of blog posts to get ready for this I think it's high time we do a compare and contrast between four AI tools that are out in the market and all saying they're the best ever so repet cursor pythagora and bolt I want to get through these in five minutes or less so repet is absolutely suitable for hobbyists like if you are just getting started if you want to code your very first app repet is a great choice because you literally start from the homepage and in 5 seconds you're into coding and it's frankly the easiest way to get in that I've seen it's going to have limitations it's not going to be suitable for more complex work I certainly had issues when I tried to pull in Google authentication into a repet app that I was messing around with and it's going to often spiral when it comes to bug fixing I've really had issues with repet where you start with a simple app and it says it's going to work and then it just it it runs into an issue and it's unable to debug itself even when you feed it a lot of error messaging so if you want to build something simple if you want to just get started with code it's super helpful the education flavor that repet brings is super useful but it's not going to be S suitable like if you need to build a production ready app but as I was saying there's four of these so we'll get to other ones that might be more suitable for that cursor is the next one I want to talk about it's a tool for developers first it assumes you have done development before implicitly it's going to run a de in in a development environment on your laptop it's going to assume that you're interested sometimes in coding manually and also in chatting and using an llm to continue to code cursor is helpful because you can actually pick the llm that you want to do the coding for you and as we know like we have different flavors with llms different llms are stronger at coding a lot of people really like Sonet 3.5 for that cursor lets you use Sonet deployment is something that cursor is's going to let you handle yourself so if you're new to development cursor may not be the thing for you because you may look at the idea of deploying and say what's going on how do I get other people to see this and if that's kind of where you're at you can get there with cursor but you have to actually walk through it step by step it's not a one-click deploy by any means so it's more suited for technical users it has really solid support for JavaScript for the react and nodejs Frameworks and I know a lot of folks who are traditional developers and want to move to llms who are swearing by cursor right now in fact if you uh look at the number one app in terms of New Growth uh per a report that came out from ramp it's cursor so ramp is a tool that like you use for corporate spend so they actually have a peak in aggregate at where people are spending on tools cursor spiked up this month and I think that's because it's so useful to development teams and not just to individuals you might also be wondering what if you're someone who's not necessarily a developer but you do want to build something that is more production ready than what replit would deliver that's where pythagora comes in so pythagora is really designed for the use case where you may not be a developer yourself but you're working in a company that needs a a business application of some sort in that situation you need something that is debugged that is reliable you need a reasonably effective deployment uh experience so it's not too complicated and it needs to actually work pythagora is really designed for that so some of their uh experiences are like hey use pythagora for building an accounts receivables app that doesn't sound super glamorous it's not something that the solopreneurs are going to necessarily build on but it is really important if you are running a $10 million trucking business and you need to get your account receivables in order and you are running them off spreadsheets and you just want to build an app that is the kind of thing that Pythagoras seems to be designed for and so it doesn't necessarily assume that you are going to know a ton about coding it simplifies a lot of the deployment it goes really really hard on automated bug testing and fixing and it's a it's a really interesting take because it essentially like each of these imply different personas like repet is implying a hobbyist Persona or targeting a hobbyist Persona cursor is going after a developer Persona Pythagoras seems to be going after someone who is perhaps non-technical or technical adjacent but who has a business use case I think that's a really interesting one because I think we're going to see a lot more of that finally bolt bolt is a really interesting one because it sort of hybridizes a few of these personas and adds a few new ones that I didn't expect sort of like repet bolt does browser-based full stack development so you're in the browser the whole time you can start typing right on the homepage to get into building things uh it's designed to have a little bit more flexibility on language than repet has um deployment is also simple like repet and it has some really interesting sort of smallscale project solopreneur flavored work that I think I'm curious to see how how they expand on so for example bolt is the only one that I found that suggests that you use their tool to build a slide deck that was a little surprising to me that's not the first thing I think of they also include you know build yourself a really pretty website do it really fast and so to me this feels almost like bolt is aiming at a technical adjacent freelancer like a photographer that has maybe played around with HTML a little bit uh and is running their photography business and wants to code up a website wants to make sure they have a calendar drop down that's the kind of thing where I think bolt would really Excel so as you can see like if you go through all four of these these are not the same application even though they use a lot of the same underlying technology and have very similar user experiences and I think one of the things that we need to do more of is compare and contrast these and talk really honestly about which ones work well which ones don't for particular use cases I don't see this being a world that's a one-size fits-all right now and I think it's important to separate these out and actually understand what each does and what each targets and so for example if I was building a small full scale app right now and I had not had previous coding experience I would probably start with bolt it's a bit of a gamble but I think bolt offers an easier way in the door than pythagora I think pythag is sort of a close second because it enables that like that automated testing and the bug fixing is something that's going to be really helpful if you're just getting started but bolt seems to offer a little more flexibility it's a bit of a judgment call right now there's not a clear winner in that space of like I'm just getting started and I want to build a fullscale app I'd be curious for your take on it now if I'm a developer I do think cursor wins hands down among those four I think it's just not close because you can get into the code in a way that's very familiar with developers and I don't think any of the other four really offer that in a way that's helpful in a way that has the power of a localized development environment so what's your take if you're a developer would you agree cursor is the right call and uh if you are a non-developer which would you use for a smallscale app development
