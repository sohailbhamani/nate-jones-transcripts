# AI Helped Me Design This Survey: How Bad Is It?

So I asked Claude for help with this and I'm trying to figure out if it's a good survey or not. I'm going to throw the link in the description under the YouTube. You can hit it and you can tell me what you think. I am trying to build an interesting Maven course that essentially helps people accelerate their tech careers. It's a question I get a lot. And of course, I've been asking AI to help with some of the course questions and the course design, but there's nothing like real people. So if you're watching this, Go underneath, go to the description, look at the link and tell me what you think. I'd love to get your feedback. And the nice thing for you is if you do that and you complete the survey, you sign up, you will get a discount code when it is time to sign up for the course. Cause thank you. Right? Like I really appreciate it. So thanks for helping me figure out what's good in this course. This is your chance to shape it and tell me what you want to hear. Cheers.
