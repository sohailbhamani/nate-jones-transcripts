# NVIDIA and Microsoft are Crashing Today Jan 27 Because of a ChatGPT Competitor Named DeepSeek

we're having a grown-up moment for AI today it's January 27th and we are making the stocks go down people sometimes ask me to give stock advice and I don't and this isn't stock advice but Nvidia is down 11% pre-market which is kind of a big deal considering they're in the trillions for valuation and Microsoft is down like 4% meta's down everybody is losing today in the stock market why why are tech companies taking a beating it's because of AI and specifically because of a company that can't launch an AI feature that's right a company I have not mentioned which seems to be doing better than most ironically it's Apple Apple's app store is still the place where ordinary stock Traders go to find out what is going on with AI I guess because deep seek hit number one in the Apple App Store over the weekend and that panicked a lot of Traders because effectively what deep seek offers is chat GPT for free it offers chat GPT for free it's quite good the model has personality they claim it was basically trained on a couple of Chromebooks and I've read the white paper and by the way I don't say that to denigrate because it is incredible mathematics and incredible engineering work so really well done the question remains whether or not you believe that they trained it on such a light set of chips how on Earth are they keeping up with the spike in demand for compute that goes with millions and millions of people supposedly downloading your app to try it no one has been talking about issues with deep seek serving all of those new requests they are getting some chips from somewhere the story is absolutely more complex than you think it is perfectly possible for this to be an incredibly well-engineered model that advances state-of-the-art in a lot of ways and also it may be hiding chips it can be both so at the end of the day I think what ordinary investors are worried about who don't sit here and stare at AI all day is they think that if this thing used fewer chips we are going to need less chips in the future they also think that if a model can be copied it means that the boat that they are betting that these large companies are building with their technical Investments isn't OTE and look I got to tell you if you thought that you could have a moat with a model you don't know AI the moat is the Innovation Edge the moat is not a model that no one can ever copy ever it's not how it works but apparently it's how Wall Street thought it worked no the reason why you invest in AI or not and this is not investment advice this is just sort of an observation you invest in AI if you believe the rocks have begun to think and there is essentially an infinite demand for intelligence if there's an infinite demand for intelligence it does not matter whether more intelligence becomes available you will always want more of it and somewhere somehow there will be plenty of market for companies to have pricing power with intelligence if you don't think there's an infinite demand for intelligence then you are going to assume that we will have no demand for further intelligence at some point and a company like deep seek will just soak up the market with a free offering deep seek has to make money too at some point like I I guess to me I look at this I'm like the only way deep seek as a model existed is because other models delivered state-of-the-art Chain of Thought reasoning built on immense compute and I assure you given the cash bur open AI is facing if there was a magical way to do this with less chips they would have done it and now that deep seek has op sourced their entire approach that's great for everybody because it means that everybody can learn from all of these advances uh Mark Zuckerberg reportedly went into founder mode over the weekend because he was so mad about sort of meta and llama and falling behind on deep seek so don't worry they will take all the learnings they can from that paper and then they will put their billions of dollars to work um but netn net at the end of the day billions of dollars are on the table because advancing the state-ofthe-art one requires a lot of chips and two then requires a lot of chips to serve if you make a request for inference compute it you're you're buying server time Sam Alman has said they lose money on 01 pro at $200 a month because people use it so much that's how much it costs I think that Jensen will be fine I really do um so we'll see this none of this is investment advice but it's sort of a moment when AI is big enough to make multi-trillion dollar companies take a hit and that's what we're seeing today all right who knows where it's going next
