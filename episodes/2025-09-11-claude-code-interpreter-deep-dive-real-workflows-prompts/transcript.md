# Claude Code Interpreter Deep Dive: Real Workflows + Prompts

Claude launched totally new capabilities to revolutionize Excel, PDFs, PowerPoints, all of that stuff. I thought it would be boring for me to just get on a video and talk about it. And I think it's way more useful if you actually see how it works in practice. So, I got on the line with my friend Rod, and we went through a bunch of workflows across Claude, across OpenAI, across Perplexity, and we broke down how this new feature from Claude works for multiple file formats, how you actually use it, how you prompt it, lots of screen sharing, lots of back and forth. I hope you enjoy this one. All right, I'm on here with Rod. Rod, do you want to just introduce yourself and sort of tell the audience a little bit about you and what makes you interested in AI? Yeah, sure. Um, thanks for having me on first of all. Great to be here. Basically, right now I'm an entrepreneur. Uh, I started my own company about two and a half years ago and I b I've used AI extensively through that process and it's not my first um it's not my first experience with AI and when I did use it before we used it around things like third party risk intelligence, right? where you're trying to understand these very nuanced scenarios that that ladder up to these more complex situations that you need to derisk. And then two and a half years ago when JAGPT came out um I I had that reckoning. I saw it. I said, "I've seen this before. This looks awesome." And I saw there was an opportunity for me to actually take the skill sets that I've been working on and bet on, you know, the foundation that AI and was building. And I've been doing it ever since. And it's been really fun and exciting just both sharing this stuff with other people, learning more about it, and then actually building my business around this. Yeah. No, that totally makes sense. Well, we have a focus for today. I want to get into some of that entrepreneurial piece, but I think we'll get into it via what launched from anthropic. So what what Claude launched and uh you can add on to this but like as far as I know the way I would put it is yesterday Claude launched a code interpreter which sounds boring but isn't because it means it can create and edit Excel spreadsheets PowerPoint slide decks word documents and PDFs directly in the web interface in the desktop app. And the devil's in the details there because if it does it well, those four document formats are this huge part of work. Like Rod, how how much of the work that you're doing touches Excel, PowerPoint, Word, or PDF? One of those four. Everything. Everything I do touches what? All of those things at various points in a week. Yeah. This is awesome. from the fact that Anthropic had the foresight to see that you know what is it that people are having difficult time with and saying like let's position our product in a way to simplify that right and I think that that's I mean I think that just it makes for a very exciting experiment that we're about yeah no I think it is and I what I want to do as part of this is I want to sort of share my screen in a minute and show you some of the tests that I've been running today um and get your live reaction to kind of like dig in because what I did was I was like okay these claims. We've heard these claims before. I think if you remember, agent mode came out, right? And Chad GPT was like, "Wow, you know, you can do Excel and spreadsheet." And I did a review on that. And it was like kind of forgettable. I didn't do a whole lot. And so my assumption when Claude launched this was to say they're trying to be play me too. They're trying to play catchup. That is not what I found. I found that it was actually surprisingly useful. So this is a uh artificial company model. So I generated a bunch of artificial data and I basically fed that data to Claude and I fed it to the agent model that OpenAI has and I wanted to see specifically how does it do at formulas because formulas are one of those things that has really beeled spreadsheets from LLMs and I was astonished because you go through here you have eight different tabs. It starts with an executive summary tab. I don't know how well you can see that we're zooming in a little bit. starts with an executive summary tab where you can see the performance of the division, the annual revenue, all of this good stuff. If you click on a cell, what you'll notice is you have these are not hard-coded numbers. These are formulas that it's actually using. And then you say, well, where do these formulas come from? You can start to click through. This is the revenue data tab that it has created, and it actually has hardcoded these so it can reference them. Uh, these are the parameters it's using. So you it's listing its assumptions. These are the scenario planning uh features it's using. So what are its multipliers for base, optimistic, etc. This is the financial analysis tab where you can actually see how it breaks down the different divisions in the company. So software, hardware, consulting division. It's calculating bonus calculations based on how the company did. And again, these are like dynamic, right? You see this is equals another tab F24. So it's actually like using that for calculations. I won't pretend these are complex calculations. I don't want to oversell this, right? But the fact that we are talking about an eight tab spreadsheet that is correct that has formulas in it that has nicely headlined like very readable headers. That is a breakthrough moment for me, Rod. Like I had a moment where I was like I think that work is going to change. Yeah, thousand%. I mean I'm still, you know, copying and pasting, you know, tables from some of the LLMs or asking them to create a CSV. Um I'm also noticing that there's a documentation. There is. Let's go look at it. Um so this has a different section. So it actually talks about like how it defines these things like what is revenue adjustment, what is IBITA, uh what are the advanced features that it implemented. And I really appreciate this because like you can actually see it documented its logic like it's using a VLOOKUP here. It's using an if statement here. Honestly, when spreadsheets I didn't documentation tasks. Absolutely not. Who has time for that? But that's the thing. It did this thing in like 3 minutes and it came back and it was like, "Holy crap." Like when I was doing spreadsheets as a marketing analyst, this this would have taken me all day. Oh, I spent plenty of days in spreadsheets just trying to make a VLOOKUP work. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So, that's cool. I think the the wow factor for me was something else. And then I want to show you also um because we were talking about powerpoints, right? And like how does it do with powerpoints etc.? Yeah. I asked it to produce a PowerPoint because do you do you recall and we may look at some agent stuff because I did ran agent through the same paces. Uh we may do that a little bit later in the call. This is what it did for PowerPoint. And again it's not I don't want to pretend that Figma designed this and this is the most impressive thing. Rod, like folks don't know how good you are at design. and you kind of hid that under a bushel in your introduction. Um, you're you're good at design. Like you could design a better slide than this, but from an LLM oneshot perspective, this is vastly better than I've seen before. This is actually really good. It's good, right? The spacing, it's doing the the small things that you take for granted. It I mean, that's a big part of, you know, the principles of design is just balance. And you know, at first glance, this is very presentable stuff. It's really like look at how they've chosen to center this in the boxes. Like that was the kind of thing that drove me nuts when I was doing PowerPoint design. Absolutely. I mean, the spacing between the boxes themselves is about balanced, right? The type faces like executive summary like proximally is the largest then it gets smaller, right? like the hier the type hierarchy. This is really really cool. The question I have for you is what did you feed what did you feed Claude for you to get this output? Let's look at the prompts. Right. What what Nate video is complete without some prompts. That's right. So I'm going to go back. Give me a second to pull up my Claude here. Um, and we're going to check out these prompts cuz I I think that a lot of the key to it is, and I found this when I was digging in and comparing Claude and agents. So, let me like state the principle and then we'll get into the example. So, what I found is that agent mode, which is the most directly comparable example, has eyes that are bigger than its stomach. It tends to do more tabs. It tends to do a more advanced spreadsheet layout plan. it tends to get deeper into the weeds on analysis, but the execution is much more poor and so the spreadsheet doesn't have complete formulas and the layout on the PowerPoint is absolutely terrible and you can't ultimately use it even though it was really aggressive. Whereas Claude is more conservative. It focuses a lot on tool use. It may not be as sophisticated at raw analysis, but what it delivers is very strong. And so with that in mind, I'll show you the um the prompt I actually used. So this is interesting. I used Perplexity to help build the prompt for this because I found that Perplexity is really good at collecting real- time data and then combining the data into like make this into a prompt, right? where you have the self-contained uh financial data or whatever it is and also the prompt all in one thing so that every model gets the same start. That's really smart. And so that's an example of using an LLM to actually have some fun with it. And so great great trick too for anyone that's listening. I mean let let the LLMs help you to craft better props. The the best thing is when you get into that circular rhythm, you start to really leverage the value pre like upfront and that's really powerful stuff. All right, so now I'm going to go over and you can see Claude here, right? This is for I did multiple problems. So I'm hopping into the prompt I used for valuing Oracle. So I don't know if you noticed, but Oracle had I think a 40% pop at the open because of their uh reporting. Uh, and ironically they missed on topline revenue and I think they missed on something else too. And the reason their stock still popped was because they issued forward guidance on AI that was so strong the market look. So I felt like that was a wonderful timely question, right? I was like, what do we make of that? Um, and so I actually why didn't you why didn't we record this yesterday before the pop so I could have invested a little bit of money into something. Thanks, Nate. Listen, right? Yeah, we need to do these like right when the earnings drop so we can have earnings uh reflections before things happen. Let's learn for next month. So, this is what Perplexity came up with. I was like, Perplexity like set this up. So, basically what Perplexi did was it said here's the challenge, right? You have to value Oracle Corporation correctly. It's going to feed you data current as of September 10th. And it just like it just makes it so easy to pull all of this. It's like this would take me forever to pull out, you know, EBA to margin and cloud revenue growth and this and that. And so it just pulls all of that out. Um it pulls out a challenge. Please provide a discounted cash flow valuation with sensitivity analysis. Um and then it goes in and says here's the current market data. Here's the fiscal. Here's the profitability. Here's the cash generation. All of this other stuff, right? Like I can go on and on and on. Is is producing this? I don't want to pretend I produced it. Like perplexity. I just asked it to do this. I had the clarity of intent. Um, and it's a complete data package. And what's interesting is I learned about prompting this model a little bit from this exercise. This prompt does not specify the output format for the model. And what Claude defaults to is not Excel. And so what you find over here on the left is Claude says, "Great, let me do the discounted cash flow valuation." It starts to kind of go through. It does all of this stuff here. It's sort of spitting out free cash flow projections, looking at terminal value, where the where the company should be valued at, uh what is the sum of present value, all of that. It does all the work. It goes to the end. It has key observations. It has an investment recommendations. It says it's fundamentally overvalued by 80%. That's insight right there. The intrinsic value cannot support the current market price. Quad is dead, ladies and gentlemen. Oracle. Time to short short Oracle. Short Oracle. I apparently that's the lesson the AI is giving us. This is not investment advice, etc. And I I I say, "Okay, uh, you did not do what I asked, but I didn't really clearly ask for it, so I don't fault it because if you look in this prompt, there's nothing here that says do an Excel." And so I say, "Okay, please formulate this as an Excel." I don't ding it. Right. Right. And it goes through and it then creates the Excel model. Um, and what's interesting is it gives me both a model and it gives me a user guide with documentation and it tells me what's in the model and everything it puts in there. Um, and so I can just download it and immediately start to use it. Um, or I think I can actually click on it here and you can see a sneak preview. So this is not really fun like it's more fun to look at it in Excel. Fun in Excel and but you can see like it's telling the truth. It has like four tabs. It has a sensitivity analysis etc. Um, this is so cool. So, that's how we're doing. Do you want to see how agent handled the same challenge? I'd love to. I'm gonna have to stop sharing my screen. I'm going have to go back and uh I'm going to go and dig up agent here. And what's interesting is agent had exactly the same challenge. It had exactly the same prompt. And it just the the response is just so different. Um, so let me pull Isn't that interesting? like across these different LLMs, your miles may vary every time and some of them are just so much better at certain things and the other ones are not and it's it's kind of a shift. I mean, that's part of why I want this conversation, Rod, because like I feel like one of the things I am taking away, one of the learnings I have as of September 10th is that if you have PowerPoint or Excel work that you need done, you need to go to Claude for that. Yeah. You should not be messing around with anything else at this point. Like it just doesn't justify. Exactly. And you know what? You know what? This also opens up a conversation around all of those rappers that have built their tooling around, you know, really changing like, you know, the themes in, you know, Google Sheets or or PowerPoint. You know, this is this is one of those rapper killers that, you know, you you look at it. I can take that presentation and I could walk I could walk into a meeting with that walk right in right like it works and that's powerful you know like one of the most powerful things that I found in my career my job is you always want to make sure that you're able to effectively communicate right the things that you're trying to share with people and you you might have a presentation or maybe it's a power up an Excel doc right and the funny thing is you need to rehearse that you need to spend the time tweaking it, going through the cycles. And you're kind of doing that in the LLM as you're going through. Like you can actually rehearse as you're building up those presentations. And all of a sudden, you don't need to stop 3 hours, 4 hours, 2 days before you need to go out and have that conversation because you could rehearse up to about 30 minutes and then say, "Hey, give me this presentation because I need to go out there and I'm well rehearsed. I know exactly what I'm talking about. There's no gotchas." And that's that's powerful. That's right. I love that call out because like there's that sense of iteriveness, right? where you are learning how to say the line, how to find the talk track as you chat with the other. Yeah, that's fantastic. That's really cool. All right, we're going to see what happened over on agent side. Uh, so you got this same prompt go through da da da da da. Uh, so it then comes back, it thinks for longer. I want to call that out because I felt the difference. Claude would come back consistently faster than chat GPT agent mode. Um, and then it comes back and says, "Okay, I'm going to give you the answer." Just like Claude, just like Claude, it comes back with an answer in text. And so it spits out a bunch of text. And by the way, I had the text here analyzed by Perplexity for both Claude and OpenAI agent mode. And the assessment is that you get a slight extra point or two on the raw analysis for agent mode because it was a little bit more conservative as a financial analyst specifically $57 a share I think and Claude had 62 and Perplexity was like you know looking at the current performance blah blah blah I think 57 probably makes more sense and I was like okay and then it was like but I admit that like both of them like think that Oracle is severely overvalued. So, it's very much a directional thing, right? So, anyway, it comes back, it gives me all this and I say, "This is not an Excel, right? Formulate this as an Excel." Here's the problem. Here's where things go south. You can see already there is no structure to this spreadsheet. Yeah, this spreadsheet is dead in the water. It's unreadable. It's unuseful. And it there there's nothing I can do to pass this around. You can't send this to someone and say, "Look at my analysis of Oracle. What do you think?" Or really honestly, "Look at Ched GPT's analysis of Oracle. What do you think?" It's use it's useless. Right. And and this is where I got really frustrated with agent. Like I I I wrote up a a summary of agent that like I'm sure did not make new friends in San Francisco, Rod, but like they were trying to say like it's the best thing since sliced bread. And I kept running it through stuff like this and I was like it doesn't deliver real workable value. I see the hype. I see the promise when it does stuff like this, right? But I can't get any work outputs. And that is the that I think is the chasm that all of these tools are trying to solve. And I think that seeing Claude do this so effectively is demonstrative of how powerful these tools are getting. You know, I mean, really is. It's also changed my workflow. I mean, I'm used to the stopping point or the edge of value of these LLMs to be, you know, the text and the structure. and I will go in and I'll spend the time to say, "Okay, I need to get it to be able to play in the playground that I am external to it. I'm not going to use any of these background tools. I'm going to I'm going to have to copy and paste things." And that itself, you know, takes time. And the fact that we're seeing Claude able to actually move from within the workspace into these tools, I mean, we're we're talking about, you know, some gamechanging stuff. And we're not really even talking about like things when I'm really curious. I want to push this to its limit. I almost want to see it do a pivot table, you know? We can do a live exercise here. I think we should like in a minute here. I want to like have you give me a live exercise and we'll like set it up and we'll run it while we chat and then we'll go back and look at it. I think that would be really fun. That would be a lot of fun. But first, I want to make you wse. You're a designer. I want to make you suffer just a little bit. I'm here for it. You are going to for better or worse, you are going to see what agent put together for the PowerPoint side of things. So this is that same report you looked at earlier. It's the same slide. Look how painful this is. It's so You know, you know what's funny is a year and a half ago, this was really impressive. I know. Time flies. This was really This was really impressive. And then you showed me Claude and now this just doesn't just doesn't work the bar. It doesn't work. Look at the these little footnotes are completely unreadable and like look this isn't title like it's just it's just kind of bad. Well, listen. I think what we're understanding here is that, you know, the certain the agent is not the designer, you know, between the two. It's clearly the agent is just, you know, he's just about the raw numbers or she well and what's interesting was that the conclusion that Perplexity came to. So, Perplexity looked at the like text outputs and basically was like if I had to pick, I would say give your assignment to agent to do some initial analysis and then feed that to Claude to actually do the report preparation and the and the PowerPoint and all of that because then you get the best of both worlds. 100%. It's funny that you bring that up too because like daisy chaining is such a powerful tool when you're using working across LLMs. It's like getting the best of all world. So yeah, that's a great call. Yeah. All right. Well, let's have some fun. I want to go to Perplexity together and I want you to help me build a prompt in Perplexity that we can feed to Claude Live and sort of have some fun with. Awesome. Because you said you had like a pivot table idea. You wanted to have fun. So what's what's your idea? What do you want to do to like challenge Claude a little bit here? And we'll see what we get. Interesting. Let's see what would make for a good You know what? Given in the spirit of using AI, let me come let me let me uh brainstorm some ideas as I would normally do. Yes GPT. Do you want to share your screen while you're doing that so we can kind of see you in the brainstorming mode or or uh are you too shy? No, I'm not shy enough, I think. Here we go. All right. Well, then great. What I will do is I will stop showing vertex for a second. This is why this is live. Um, and you can share your screen, I think. Share button down there. And here we go. So, I'm just going to straight up ask, help me brainstorm a few ideas around making a fun pivot table. I love that we're using the phrase fun pivot table. Like, who says that? This is why I want to It's 2025, you know? LLMs have changed our entire perspective. Pivot tables are now fun. Make it dynamic. Make the suggestion a All right. GBD5. Let's see what it says. Movie night. Pivot hacker. Fitness fun. Travel vibes. Recipe. These are very consumer focused. They are. Should we make them a little more Should we change them and make them a little more corporate? I mean, we could or we could stick with this. You get the test either way, I think. What do you think? What do you want to do? Let's go with movie night. Let's make a movie night pivot table. Movie night pivot table. Okay. Let's throw that into Perplexity. So, I'm going to go over to Perplexity. Uh, or do you want to go to Perplexity? What I'll do is I'll copy and paste this over to you so you can paste it, right? And then I can pop it in. Okay. Go ahead. A little team effort. We're gonna have to find a way to bridge our uh our hive mind AI. That's right. I love those. While I'm while I'm sending this over to you via the interwebs. Yes. What are you What are you thinking that is the most unique part of this launch that made you just say, "Oh, this is this is different. This is worthwhile." What made you really excited about this one? I Well, I think I shared this at the top. I was primed to be bored. I was primed to not be excited. My expectation was this is not going to be that much because I've seen this hype before. And what I found was just the ability to deliver on promises around work done became really really compelling for me because it meant that I could be in a spot where I felt comfortable giving a bigger piece of responsibility to AI which in turn like if if I think about it like a lot of the question we face that we wrestle with is what do we trust AI to do? How do we delegate effectively? And how much time does that give us back? How do we multiply ourselves as AI professionals? And this feels like one of those things where like I can I can see all of these places through my day where I can start to delegate differently and I can push more to Claude because I can trust him. That makes a lot of sense. I mean, that's one of the things I'm I'm looking for whenever I see these um a launch or any of these guys, whether it's Anthropic or OpenAI put out a new announcement, always curious on like how can it change my day-to-day, you know, and then quickly try to get in there and and and tease out that value. Exactly. Okay, I picked up the text. Um so, I'm gonna go back. I'm gonna share my screen. And I have the text I think in my clipboard and we're just going to start to build a prompt live that we're going to hand to Claude and see what we get. So the pasted text, it's movie night. Um, and what I basically want to ask Perplexes is I want to say uh I want you to uh take this seed of an idea and expand on it. Uh specifically, you need to build a prompt for another LLM to construct a pivot table spreadsheet uh that includes uh a list of 20 uh to 25 recent movies uh categorized as described below. Um and the pivot table needs to be very usable um and userfriendly. So this is like me actually like prompting raw here. Uh in addition, the prompt you construct must contain all of the data the LLM needs to construct the pivot table. do not assume the LM can go and get movie data, you get the movie data. And that I found was really key. Uh because you can't try and give it like the research job and the Excel creation job in one go at this point. um it will go and do research, but I find it's much more effective to have Perplexity do the research and then come back with something like a self-contained prompt and then work. Um, and what that suggests, by the way, is that if you're working with internal company data and you're working with Claude, you're going to end up in a position where you need to be constructing a prompt very intentionally pulling in internal company data as part of the prompt construction process and then giving it to Claude. Yeah, 100%. And I think that that's going to be a nice exercise for us as we see this first version that it spits out because I'm already thinking about like, you know, maybe we want to just focus on say the Marvel Cinematic Universe and then we want to overlay characters, you know, and then we want to add actresses and all this fun stuff. So, I'm really excited to see what what uh what Perplexity puts out there. generating a complete data set of recent movies. So like I cannot believe that here we are in 2025 and this is just a casual prompt that you and I are just throwing up. Look out IMDb, you know, right? Yeah. You know, one of the things that I think that people don't realize, I was talking with someone uh earlier today who uh I mean he's a company leader and he hadn't he he uses perplexity. He loves Perplexity, but he didn't realize that you could hit these three different options on the bottom, and he just defaults to search and loves it. And I was like, there is more to Perplexity. You can do even cooler. You You unshackled him. I did. I Well, I'm hoping I did. We'll see. Um, so it gives me like a bunch of uh recent movie titles. It gives me a bunch of view records data uh showing who watched what when. Uh, it gives me pivot table specs. It gives me expected output examples. user experience requirements. This is very complete. This is this is very very thorough. Do we want to just like run it and see what happens? Absolutely. All right. All right. We're going to go run it and see what happens. Okay. I'm going to stop sharing and I'm going to paste it into Claude and we're going to see what we get. I'm excited. I'm rubbing my hands. I'm not even doing anything. I'm like, this is going to be really fun. All right. So, we're going to copy it. Um, and I'm glad I told it to be self-contained because there's no way I would be writing all of that stuff out. All right. So, I'm pasting it in and I actually want to do this live. So, once I get it queued up, I'm going to share my screen again and we're just gonna see how it goes. Okay, here we are. Gonna share my screen and go back to Claude. Lot of screen sharing in this one because there's so much cool stuff to look at. Um, okay, here we are. And literally like it pasted it in and you can open it up and look at it and you can see uh this is the instruction. It does specifically say create a spreadsheet. So, I'm hoping I don't have to remind it to create the spreadsheet this time. It has all the data we looked at. Uh, in addition, it dumped in a bunch of URLs because it just can't help itself. That makes the prompt slightly dirty, but I don't care. I'm just leaving it in for now, and we're just going to see what it does. I love how Perplexity loves citation. It does. It really does. Um, and so it's starting to go through. Uh, it's going to create a So, so it's first analyzing it. So, it's got the Python script up here. You can actually see it like starting to code it in, which I This is just addictive to me. Like, I love this. Look at the data. Yeah, the world is a different place now. It's just wild. It's It's so funny that there was a time where doing something like this was extremely time inensive. And I say a time as if that wasn't as if that was a couple years ago. It just feels so far away. Like we are such creatures of convenience that the moment you put things like this in front of us, we were like, "Give me. This is the new the new floor." You know, it's really cool. And so it's just going through and as far as I know, like it's not even touched the spreadsheet. So, it all it did was it used Python to figure out what it was going to do and then it's decided, okay, now we're going to build a pivot table. Um, and we're going to like actually start to bring an Excel file with quote unquote advanced features. So, we'll see how it does on that. I really love the way it thinks. I love the way it's it does the thinking out loud and yeah the and the way that it's leveraging Python to give it a P, right? so that it can then use that. And I think that's that's something that I'm noticing across the different LLMs. And I think that the engineers are getting smarter about this like they know that there are certain languages that just lend themselves well to going from human language to you know computer that computers speak and Python is just one of those languages. So if you could get into Python, all of a sudden shifting into other languages becomes a lot easier because you're getting that structure built in. So really really cool stuff when you when you're actually paying attention to what's um what's going on there. Uh you're not just pure vibing, which I love to do too. I mean, you know, a good a good vibe is great. I think that when I'm able to pay attention, I notice that Claude, like if I'm not running back and forth between 20 different things, I notice that Claude is much better about this than OpenAI. Like the the tool record here is really clean. I can see exactly what it did all the way through. And now like it loves documentation, so it's creating me a read me. I didn't even ask it to create me a read me. This is so great. How to use the spreadsheet. Thank you, Claude. Sometimes Claude is a little bit a little bit stuck up, but I love it so much. I don't mind it. Can Can you laminate it? Can you collate it? Laminated and and mail it to me too, please, Claude. That'd be great. So, you remember Calvin and Hobbs? Claude has the personality of Susie Derkens to me. Like, it's it's that kind of a model. That's a great call back. Yeah, I love Calvin Hobbs. It's so good. My kids are addicted to it. Um, okay. Okay. Oh, wow. It overachieved. It has a a complete pivot table and apparently an enhanced analytics version. What? Amazing. Amazing. Okay, we have to see what's in here. Uh, so I'm going to download both of these. Um, and I'm going to pull down the readme. I actually want to open these in Excel because I think this is just a crappy way to look at it. So, give me a second. We're look at this in Excel and see what's in the box. It's gonna be very hot. Excited. I think we While you're pulling that up, I'm I'm also excited to see how how Microsoft and these other companies respond to this, right? Like the amount of dynamic behavior that they're going to have to start introducing to their products. It's just opening so many doors. Yeah. So, it's so cool. My gosh, look at this. Okay. I didn't even know it could do this. I know. I just I I'm killing you. The suspense alone h half the audience is is keeled over. Yeah, I think has become exciting thanks to Nate and Rod. Um, so this is the enhancement. It did color coding. Oh, heat coloring. Yeah, it heat maps. I'm like kind of impressed. I didn't ask it to heat map. It volunteered. Cool. It did pattern analysis. Look at this. Wow. I'm kind of blown away. I didn't know it could do this. Rod, this is also me reacting. Are those Those are little like uh Do you zoom in? They're like spark lines or something. Smart graph line thingies. Whatever you call these things. I don't even know. Like I I I'm not the the Excel expert here. What do you call these things? Spark lines. No, I don't. I I use language that I didn't didn't really know. Like little bar graphs or something. Yeah, they're little bar graphs right in the cell. And then it has this cute little like okay like you know take away a little credit because the genre is on top of the bar but whatever like I would say good uh you get friend statistics so you can see what these different friends like unique movies diversity etc. You get your top 10 movies ranked. So like this is the Suzie Derkens overachievement version and then it has all the raw data right and the raw data that's what we love to see. That's so good. Yeah. So, like you can tell I'm not lying is the implication, right? Um, and so there it is. And so that's the enhanced version. I'm going to go ahead and share with you what it called the basic version, which I thought was still perfectly usable. And you can kind of see like I think you get a sense of like what it thinks is special, which is its own little piece of insight to grab. So yeah, this is it. This is regular movie night without the heat mapping. Um, so it's exactly the same table. So you see the 12 is there and all you have is a nice clean traditional finance table with blue and white rows data perfectly understand but you know they segment out each of the uh viewers that's that was not in the enhanced version so they actually data on Alex Jordan Casey Morgan and Riley and you can see like how they go by day what their genres are and so in a sense like one of the things that I am learning from this is that you have to the the more interesting you make the prompt for Claude, the more likely Claude is to give you some permutations. And what I might do in a followup here is basically say, "Claude, I loved the heat mapping on the pivot table. Can you please preserve the heat mapping, but also give me the viewing pattern pivots and like do a modification like as a That'd be really cool." Actually, open up the pivot table. Uh, this one all friends. Yeah. Yeah. And can we pull in can we go into the If you click on data. Uh where's data? Okay. Yeah, up here. Please go away. Um yeah data. Let me take a look. It's been a long time since I've been inside Excel. I will tell you that. Are you looking for or something? I'm looking for the pivot. There's a there's a table that you could actually see how it creates the cross relationships. Oh, is it in analysis tools? Is it? No, it's not. Um, what if analysis, text to columns, flashfill, queries, and connections. That's it, isn't it? Is that it? No, that's not it. Um, we'll have to find that later. I don't think we're finding. We will. That looks really cool. This is This is awesome. Yeah. No, it's super fun and I'm learning a lot, too, as we chat. So, there you go. That is it. That is what Claude has launched. Do you have any takeaways from this? I'm I'm excited. Say that again. Do you have any takeaways? Like what what are you taking away from this conversation? I mean, for me, what I'm realizing is that the idea of using these tools is no longer relegated to just me as a person. The amount of decisions that I need to make around getting something valuable out of the outputs that I'm getting can really really start diving into the more interesting bits, right? One of the awesome things that we've seen over the past couple of years with these LLMs is that we all get, you know, we're all over the first 20, 30, 40%. And most of us by the time we're really proficient at what we do, the 80% is pretty much, you know, you could phone it in, but it's that last 20% that makes things go from good to great. And the fact that we could spend more time focusing on that 20% and this is a perfect example of that makes for a really interesting like future in like both you know the professional space just the communication aspect. I mean this is just really really cool stuff. So so I want to give you a philosopher quote that I promise is relevant that I am taking away as I look at this. Um this is from Alfred North Whitehead um who famously said, "Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking of them." That's actually really that's a really good one right there. And I feel like extended civilization because there are important operations where I didn't tell it to put the heat map in. I didn't tell it to center the the text on the PowerPoint slides. It just did it and I didn't have to think about it. That's awesome. Yeah, I like that. I also like that positioning. Anthropic might come knocking, mate. At this point, you're you're saying that Anthropic by extension is extending civilization. Just fantastic. Yeah. No, I'm sure. Well, if Daario calls, I'll pick up the phone. Well, thank you for having Thank you for for chatting a little bit. Thank you for making time. I know this was a bit of a last minute thing. We're having fun. First of May, loved it. Looking forward to doing another. Have a good one, Nate. Cheers.
