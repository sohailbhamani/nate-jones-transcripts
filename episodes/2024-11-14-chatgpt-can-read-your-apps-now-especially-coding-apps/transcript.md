# ChatGPT Can Read Your Apps Now - Especially Coding Apps

all right which would you rather have would you rather have the artificial intelligence control your keyboard and your mouse or would you rather have the artificial intelligence see your screen and collaborate with you those are the two bets that are being made right now Claude made the first bet and thropic released Claud for computer use and you can actually drive it around on the screen and use the mouse and all of that it runs at about a million tokens every 15 minutes on the other hand Chad GPT today released a update to their desktop app that allows you if you are paying for their service right if you're a plus or an Enterprise customer to use chat GPT to read specific apps on your computer so it's designed to read coding apps initially and they will expand it to other things eventually basically the bet is would you rather collaborate with Chad GPT while you are working on these apps and CH GPT can just look directly at what you're doing maybe at the code that you're writing and give you ideas or do you think it's more helpful for Claude to directly Drive the screen my sense is both of these are experimental and we are going to converge I see these as modalities of operation I think Claude has made the Bolder bet and the bet that is more likely to feel like a beta I played with with chat GPT it doesn't really feel like a beta even though they're labeling it a beta it reads your code just just fine and you can talk with it and it gives you perspective it feels really stable it also feels like a smaller bet for that company to make I suspect that because it feels stable they're going to be looking at expanding it in the next few weeks to cover cover other apps we will see but my sense is giving the llm the ability to read but not write is much much less risky than trying to get it to fully use the system autonomously and so that's a way for chat GPT to expand the usage to expand the surface of your work that it covers and to do so relatively efficiently right this is not necessarily a difference in intelligence for them it's just giving chat GPT a pair of eyes that it didn't have before to read very specific programs so we will see if you look at it this way it looks like the kind of positioning that is designed long-term to displace AI assisted development environments because you could be an any development environment and be AI assisted right there now it doesn't actually write the code directly in the development environment yet and so one of the key differences for example with cursor is that cursor literally will write the code using the large language model and I have heard varying responses from developers on this that if you're a developer I know you have opinions some developers are going to prefer the model that chat GPT just released today where it doesn't write the code but it gives you a perspective it gives you an opinion it helps you debug so I think there's a market for this if you have downloaded the new chat GPT give it a try let me know what you think
