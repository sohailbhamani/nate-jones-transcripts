# AI Certifications Focus on Tools NOT Skills—Here's a Better Way

How do I learn AI? That is the topic of the video this week. I want to talk specifically about how we move from an idea that AI is a single competency to the idea that AI is a related group of competencies that we can all stand to get better in. And I want to talk about a tool that I'm using to measure that. But let's talk about how we think about AI as a multi-dimensional skill set first because I think if you don't believe me on that, none of the rest of it is going to make sense. And I have to be honest here. I think most of the courses out there are not doing any of us any favors because they view tool competency as equivalent to AI competency. So as an example, if you get an open AI certification, it certifies you for use in the tool and they may tell you it certifies you for AI, but any given organization, Claw, Gemini, OpenAI, I they're all make great models and they're doing good work on the training part for the tool. But we shouldn't mistake the tool certification for an understanding of artificial intelligence, especially in a world that is multimodel. If you have gathered anything from what I've been talking about the last month or two with the launch of Gemini 3, with the launch of Opus 4.5, we are living in a multimodel world. Chad GBT 5.1, right? Every week a new model comes along. Grock 4.1 last week. It's a multi-model world and we need to be ready for AI fluency that scales as models continue to proliferate and to grow and to evolve. And so if you're looking at the elements of a multi-dimensional skill set, you have to look above the level of the tool. I don't know very many courses that think that way. And the ones that do tend to look at a particular job family and say, are you certified in AI for engineering? Are you going to be focused on AI for product management? whatever it is. And they don't tend to think about AI as a new core skill set above the level of the tool that we all need to be good at. Regardless of job family, there are foundational AI skills we all need to know. You're going to be asking me, Nate, what are those skills? I'm going to suggest to you that there are five critical skills that we need to get better at, that we need to grow in, that we need to have in our growth kit for AI, regardless of what job family we're in. and we will use them. I'm they're all practical. Number one is a sense of AI strategy. Strategy is not just for executives anymore. Strategy is for all of us because AI puts artificial intelligence as a team member on all of our teams. We have to have the strategy to know how to deploy that AI intelligence correctly. We have to have the strategic insight if we're looking at products to know what is the right product that moves my workflow forward. If we're in any of the building spaces, Videoding, engineering, I don't care what it is, you have to have a strategic understanding of the market and how AI fits into that market. It is not something you can outsource to just one executive part of the business anymore. Prompting, that's another multi-dimensional skill set. You need to know not just how do I prompt for a particular task, but how do I evolve and change and think about that prompting as it shifts, right? How do I think about prompting Gemini differently from chat GPT? How do I think about prompting for a deck differently than a doc? I released a prompt tool because of this gap just this week called Hey Presto, and it's designed to help you figure out how to form intent through prompting. But prompting is a skill set that is above the level of the tool. You can use any tool. I don't care if it's Hey presto or any of the other hundred tools out there on prompting badly or you can use them well. And that is your skill set that drives that. And that is something that we haven't got a good handle on how to teach yet because it's so new. The third critical skill set that I want to talk about is how you think about integrating AI into your workflow. I talk so much about AI being useless if it lives off to the side. What does it mean if AI is deeply connected and tied in and integrated into your workflows? How do you design workflows that are AI native? So, they're integrated in that is also a learnable skill set that we need to practice and teach on, but very few people teach on it. Critical evaluation, that's another one. How do you evaluate the output of an AI critically with good taste, with good judgment, so that you can say with confidence and authority, this is good and this is terrible. I was working on a little fun test today between Gemini 3 and Chad GPT 5.1 Pro and Claude and I was asking them to write me a creative story because one of the interesting bars for LLMs, even if you're using them in a business context, is how they form narrative. And so I asked them and I gave them the same prompt for a story. I had to use my taste to figure out what the best answer there was. I had to read through the three different stories that they made me to figure out which one was the highest quality. I'm still digesting it. Don't ask me. I'm still thinking it through. So this is a skill that we need to develop and it's a skill we need to develop that we can use in a wide range of context for numeric data, for decks, for docs, etc. The final big piece of skills that I don't think we talk enough about is the ethics piece. And people often sort of roll their eyes and say ethics is for ethics officers. And I say the ethical choices we're all facing are actually so multi-dimensional and so woven into our work that we probably need to have an understanding regardless of where the lines should be. I'll give you a few examples. One is from Nano Banana Pro. It can make passport pictures. Now, now the simplest ethic thing is don't fake a passport, right? Like that's a really easy one. But a complicated one is how do you think about installing guardrails in systems so that your system is not vulnerable to a model change in output generation capability that would enable something like that to get through. That's system design and ethics. You can also think about in the same vein, how do you change the way you have security policies so that you have in-person or physical asset policies where needed to make sure that you aren't being spoofed by something like a fake passport photo? Or you can start to think about it a different way. How do you build trust in your product experiences? How do you ensure that people trust what you are making and that you are one of the good guys if your model can be used so many different ways? Where where's the right line for guard rails? And so I am firmly convinced that the question of how LLMs ought to act, which we traditionally call ethics, is really a question of product design to build trust. And we are all in the business of either designing products that use AI or using products in such a way that we want to build trust with others. I would argue that the way we use products to build reports for sales or the way we use them to build white papers can either be trust building or not and that is again it falls under that banner of ethics. So I've given you sort of a painted picture across strategy and prompting and uh integration into workflows critical evaluation fix and I've done that for a reason. We constantly misjudge ourselves when we don't understand the core skill sets that we need to learn because we tend to overindex on one of them while ignoring the others. I will tell you frankly of those five most of what I hear is unprompting and I think that's frankly an impoverished view of the rich LLM skill set that we need to develop. Most AI fluent users tend to be strong in only one or two pillars and they tend to be weaker in the rest. If you don't measure across all fives, you don't get a real picture of how someone thinks, how they work, how they reason through ambiguity. So where am I going? Why does this matter? Real AI work blends all of these skills, the judgment, the synthesis, the workflow design, the rapid learning, and the ability to in interrogate models into a overall application on a particular task that delivers value. If you can only prompt, but you can't evaluate output, that's dangerous. If you're great at strategy, but you can't operationalize a workflow, it's not going to work out. You get the idea. This is where I want to point you to a tool that I did not build. This is a tool that one of my Substack readers built with my permission using a prompt set from a very popular uh post that I made about evaluating AI fluency. He's done a fantastic job. It's called AI Cred. I'll show it to you in a few minutes. We'll talk with him a little bit. I am sharing this with you because this is a way for me to start to give you tools to understand AI fluency to test yourself on AI fluency. It's a little bit fun. There's a little leaderboard um but most importantly to give you resources to grow that I haven't seen collected and customized in any other way. And so the idea with AI credit is it does go across that full multi-dimensional skill set. Strategy, prompting integration critical evaluation, ethics, workflow design, synthesis. It's a very comprehensive assessment of your AI skill set. It's one you can retake and grow in. It is a hard test to do well in. That is on purpose. I believe the leaderboard on AI cred right now, nobody scores above an 8.9 out of 10. No one has hit nine yet. So maybe you're going to be the first one. It is really tough. And when you answer honestly and when you see your actual score across these different multi-dimensional skill set, it empowers you. It gives you options to succeed because it's going to come back with custom resources that I spent a lot of time picking out and tailoring so that the recommendation you get is tied to the specific gaps in your skill set that allow you to improve. I don't want to give you a one-sizefits-all course. I've been asked for a long time, Nate, can you give me just a course on AI so I can scale up? And because the answer is custom, because it involves this multi-dimensional skill set, I can't just point you in good conscious at one tool and say, "Learn that tool." I can't just point you at one particular course and say, "That's just going to make it work." I want to point you at a thousand courses, right? And point at a bunch of resources to read, but only in bite-sized chunks that are tied to your particular gaps. And that's where AI cred comes in because it custom assesses you for your unique skill sets and it's consistent. So you can reassess yourself in a month or in two months or in three months and say where am I at? Have I made progress? Did the resources I actually dug into and learn change the way I work and think? Because that's the other piece I see is that so often when we talk about AI fluency, it is a piece of paper we staple to the wall. it is not getting into our head and into our hands and onto the keys. And this measures whether that outcome is actually. So with that, I am going to transition over. I'm going to start chatting with Jonathan who did so much of the heavy lifting to help to put this together. I'd love to hear his story of the build, share it with you guys, share AI cred a little bit, and that's what the second half of this video is going to be about. Let's enjoy. All right, I am here with Jonathan. Uh really the guy who built AI Cred. Uh, I want the second half of this video to be all about sort of one, how how this came to be, how you make the build decisions to build a tool like this and then of course what the tool does. I'd love to get into the tool, show it on screen, demo it a little bit, um, and talk about it. Uh, so that everyone knows like, hey, this is what it is, right? It might be for you, it might not be for you, but either way, you know, about AI. So, Jonathan, maybe introduce yourself and, uh, let's jump into it. >> Yeah. So, uh, I don't know. I'm a I'm a filmmaker out of northeastern Pennsylvania uh Wilsbury Scranton area. I I've been running a production company for the last 20 years and uh and I got started with AI like everyone else and just I got a little bit addicted and uh as I was building workflows out for my video editing and uh I don't know I did some really cool stuff and I I was fascinated with what AI was giving me the ability to do and I couldn't stop talking about it. tried to find other people to talk about it and you know ended up following you and uh you know that's the that's the super a bridged version of the story. So >> yeah, we'll we'll take it. We'll take it. We're heading into Thanksgiving. We'll take the a bridged version. Um so how about a guy cred? Like what what brought you into that? I know that we've been working together on that one for a bit, but what was what was that sparked that for you? Um, so Nate, I I gotta tell you, you keep on making these videos and these guides and these these prompts and uh and all these notes over here, but every third post you make could be an app. And um because and I I think one of the things we're most aligned on is uh is really trying to share our skills and everything like that. And when you when you made that post uh about those prompts determining your AI fluency, I'm like, man, that's what people need. We need, you know, you need to identify where you're at and you have to, you know, and that getting that foundation is what's going to help you um move forward. Uh >> yeah, that that makes a lot of sense. I think in a sense my my goal has always been to put out good stuff and let it sort of percolate through the internet. And I think one of the things I'm really excited about is that sometimes stuff really lands. And it feels like with AI cred, the the vision goes well past Substack. You don't have to be a Substack person for this to get the idea that fluency matters, that learning AI matters. Um, and it's something that should be evergreen and available and all of us should be able to just dig in on our own pace and do. >> Yeah. No, I agree. It's it's not even about the tools you use like whatever model like we've been stressing the the core principles that you're always that you're always pushing like the the fluency really does matter regardless of tool tools how to you know learning how to communicate with AI. I mean honestly it helps you learn how to communicate with people as well which is super cool. Um >> well actually I would love to hear and see a little bit about AI cred. Maybe you can throw it up on the screen. Walk us through what it looks like and then sort of toward the second half would love to talk a little bit about like using AI to build AI like how you actually built it and put it together. I think that's a nice little uh touch we can do afterward. So right now what we're looking at is the dashboard. Um, I went ahead and I got my I'm I'm currently just not not to brag or anything, but I'm I'm number one on the leaderboard. >> We'll see how long that lasts. >> Yeah. Um, so, um, you you can see your score up here. And this is going to be pretty different tomorrow, but, uh, right now you can go in, you can take your assessment, and so you see your fluency score. we have you know your your sectional breakdown. So the fluenc the the evaluation works in six different sections. It talk you know it's the introduction and report you know talks about what you've done where you know what you're experienced in your tech technical fundamentals uh different use cases that you use AI for prompt engineering skills your strategic thinking and then you know how you apply things practically and uh man uh I just switched over >> really breakdown isn't it? Yeah, it's insane. Especially I I switched it over to Opus 4.5 yesterday. It just >> oh my god, it it it just gives some crazy stuff. It gives you a competitive context. >> Um that competitive context is that about like you in relation to your peers. >> Yeah, pretty much just um you know how you know for example mine reads uh Jonathan operates in the top 5% of AI practitioners. his combination as a system thinking documented workflows and active frontier uh experimented experiment I I can't read uh places him well above most professionals including blah blah blah so uh I'm feeling a little self-conscious reading that right now because it really talks >> uh the brutal truth is where I feel a little less >> you know so >> um so you've mastered personal AI fluency and built an impressive and built impressive systems, but uh you're still operating as a solo practitioner. Your knowledge transfer has reached maybe 12 people through one-on-one work, and that's not scale. Now, here's the thing. This is where it's wrong. Well, it's hopefully it's going to be wrong tomorrow. Uh your your assessment app is in the right direction, but it's still MVP with no revenue validation. Your technical depth is genuine asset, but also a blind spot, you know, >> but then you can retake it, right? That's what I've been saying is with AI cred, you can go back and retake your score and you can kind of see how you're growing. And so that's an example for you where you could you could be growing. >> And here's the thing. Um, and I don't know if you've seen this part. Um, and my god, I I hope it uh let's see. I I Okay, here we go. Start your training plan. I have not clicked this button yet. >> Oh, we're >> on my profile. So, um, yeah, it's going to take a minute. So, what it's doing right now is it's actually building a training plan. And, um, your original prompt told it all to build it at once. I I'm a little bit of a psycho, so I wanted each maj. So, uh, module two, three, four, five, they won't be generated without the context of the p previous module. >> Okay. So, let's look at the module content in module one. What is it suggesting for you? >> So, we're going to hop into module content. And this is all live. Thank god it works. Uh, >> this is why we're launching it because it actually works. I know it's the builder's nervousness here, but this is good. >> Yeah. Yeah, for real. Um, so yeah, focus area gives you a hand on hands-on exercise. Um, let me make that larger for everyone. >> Yeah. Yeah. um you know it wants me to design and ex execute a two-hour workshop for group of five non-technical users teaching one core AI workflow then we could take a progress check and this is AI graded so I could you know it actually gives you a quiz and >> oh this module and in your case because your work challenge or your growth challenge is scaling your impact to others the exercise is about that >> exactly yeah and uh and then when you finish that module and you take the quiz. Uh, and this is all free. You know, the evaluation cost of credit, but all these modules, they're entirely free. You know, you you pay to get free education. >> Y >> So, uh, yeah. Uh, you could take your progress. you're getting that whole learning plan that evolves with you because this is really cool because it basically like you'll take the progress check and depending on how you respond, it's going to customize module 2 to what I particular need. And that was honestly one of the things that took me forever to build in um >> because when you get done with your learning path, it doesn't end there. Uh you take a reassessment which builds on the context of your first conversation, >> all your training modules, >> and then it reassesses you and then it regenerates a brand new training, you know, learning path and >> it's it's super rad. Um >> and tell me about like and just the way you're designing it. Like there's obviously hands-on exercises. What other things are there? resources, videos, like how does it like start to pull all that together? >> Well, what we're doing right now is right now I have a basic uh you know a basic database. >> Um I would like to call it a rag, but it's not a rag yet. That's I'm being you know it's just it's just my sequel but uh uh it it pulls from honestly almost entirely you and training >> you know AI training modules uh I have you know there's many many more versions to come there's little you know there's I I have a road map that's 10 miles long but >> um yeah that's that's where it pulls from a lot of the training that you've done I What are you posting? Six six videos and four posts a day lately. >> It's I also age in dog ears, Jonathan, I will tell you. >> No, >> the beard grows ever wider. >> Um, and just to show off a couple more things that I really like. Uh, uh, so a lot of people really like, you know, well, we ran we ran a prototype of this, uh, two months ago >> uh, in in your private substack. Yeah. Um, so for anybody who doesn't know, Nate Substack has this whole group of people like >> hundreds of people that are like obsessed with AI. So that's the place to be. >> Um, we we ran a prototype and had just over a hundred people sign up for it and they were all dying to see the other people's scores like so >> begging to and that's why we added the social piece, the leaderboard piece. >> Yep. So, we have this profile page, which please please ignore the This is going to be fixed tomorrow. I promise. >> You You can barely see the text. >> The lime green there. Yeah. >> Yeah. Yes, that'll be fixed tomorrow. >> No, it's authentically built, right? Like it's not like it's a bunch of VC money here. >> Yeah. Yeah. So basically, you know, you could add add your social links, you could add your own bio, but it it it ranks you right here. Yeah. >> Um uh it actually tells you what position you are in the leaderboard. Uh I have this, you know, this wingman summary. A lot of people are >> well me in particular, I don't like bragging about myself. So if your public profile or if you make your profile public, you get an automatic augment. >> Brag about yourself. If the AI just is your wingman and talks about you for you. >> Exactly. >> You can share your links here. Um and uh of course you can take a look at the leaderboard which again I just not going to brag. I'm number one. >> Somebody's got to be Jonathan. That's my ask to the world. Go be Jonathan. >> Then we have uh we have a few other users. My wife by the way 5.5. I got to tell 5.5 is a phenomenal score. >> Yeah. This isn't a hard test, isn't it? Like I I I made this one brutal. >> Th This is So you you you see these numbers like 8.7, 8.9, 8.6. These are some test users that have like >> hardcore been in AI for >> Yeah. >> You know, since the day Chat GPT was released, you know, they >> uh and they're they're crazy. Michael Dion's a good developer friend of mine. Um and I just met him, so he's he's good people. But uh yeah uh and my wife like I was shocked that she got a you know the average person gets like a 1.4 to a two. >> Yeah. >> Uh somebody who's been using chat GBT and stuff just casually and stuff like that and actually trying a little bit is more around a three. 5.5 is ridiculous. >> It's really Yeah. Yeah. No. And I'm sure that like people will come at me but like when I wrote the fluency algorithm I was like I don't care about grade inflation. I know it's a thing. We're not doing it here. If you earn your way to whatever score, it's a real score. It's hard. You should be proud. >> Yeah, for real. And it it's absolutely true. I I um So, uh last couple things. Uh this is the homepage >> right now. We have the leaderboard right there on the homepage. The top 10 people are going to be here >> on there. That's right. That's the challenge. >> Yep. And uh and then you can search for your friends. Um so >> oh you can search for I didn't even know this. This is so cool. So you can see >> so the only people who show up on the leaderboard are people who have actually gone through the evaluation. So here this is this is my son's page. He has not gone through the evaluation. Uh but he was >> his page. Yeah. >> Yeah. He sent me so many errors and bug fixes and he's, you know, uh, >> I'm the god of finding bugs. I love this. >> Yeah. So, and of course he linked to his TikTok here. >> Yeah. So, coming back to the build story, how did you build this with AI? Tell us a little bit about that. You can pull the screen down if you want. We can just chat. >> Um, or you can show what you're building. Like that's also all totally cool. Well, I used every tool known to man. So, so I started um I started working uh it's just using clawed code and uh and then jumping from system to system to system and uh you know finding out what work like for example codecs like I I hate using codeex but I love using it to review what Claude did because Claude is a little bit silly sometimes. And >> tell me more about that. A lot of people are really keen for the like hands-on Claude versus Codeex comparison. I think you have an opinion there. Dig into that for me. >> I have a strong opinion there. Like I get um so uh Codeex Codeex straight up ignores you when you ask it to use tools. Period. Okay. Um, and yeah, like well, I mean, you do have to prompt it in a certain way, but you have to do it every single time. Like, hey, use this tool to do this job. By the way, you do have access to this tool. This is how you use this tool. And all that has to be in your prompt. And that drives me insane. So, I just use Claude, you know, I just use codeex for code review because it's phenomenal at that. It it'll go through >> Yeah. that, you know, it it'll help me plan. It'll help me check the plans. it'll find all the faults in the plans. But then I have Claude execute cuz you know Codeex is lazy about execution in in my opinion, you know, and you could prompt your way out of that. But I don't know. I just I I just really like the experience with Claude. I had a few days with Gemini 3 last week that blew me away and then Opus 4.5 came out and I I haven't even thought about use, you know, using Gemini 3 again. Uh because it has its quirks. Gemini 3 scares the hell out of me. Um, you know, when you when you're watching it uh its thought chain, you know, the it it starts off it always starts off like speaking in the first person for some reason, like repeating your prompt in the first person like, hey, I'm really focused on this and I'm really focused on this and then it'll say the wrong thing >> and then it'll dig into saying the wrong thing >> and you're like desperately trying to pull it out of the mud in your head and you're like and then maybe it selforrects but you don't know. >> Yeah. Then then you right as you go to click cancel it's like >> it it'll it'll be like no no no I'm wrong I should be doing this. They're like oh okay thank god >> because it was just about to touch something you didn't want it to touch. And uh >> I think that happens with AI more than we realize. And Gemini made a very bold choice to expose that because I think that behind the scenes there is a lot of what I would call temporary misinterpretation. Like with Claude for example, I often see if it's if it's streaming the train of thought, it will say something absolutely nasty to me. Like I'm thinking about the user's underdescribed prompt or something awful like that >> and I'm like, "What do you mean? This thing is like a 50line prompt and it's because it hasn't opened the prompt up and it's just kind of like thinking >> and then eventually it gets into it and opens it out." >> Yeah. I I'll do my standard like, you know, here's a list of things, you know, I'll just, you know, I'll just use whisper flow and just talk to it for like five minutes and then I'll do the standard like, hey, please explain to me what you think I'm talking about and wait for me to confirm or or clarify. And it will it'll do that whole thing. It'll make this huge list and it'll be like and I'll clarify or whatever. But if it's right, I'll I'll tell it, "Yeah, please proceed." It be like in the first chain of thought is like what is the user talking about? This is super vague. And I'm like what? >> And yet from there we get to you're absolutely right with claude >> every time. Yeah. As soon as you see you're absolutely right, you should clear your context immediately. Like that go away. It just it's it's the sign to run away. >> That's a bad omen. >> Okay. So you're using cloud code, you're using codeex. Uh any other vibe coding tools? Uh the prototype of this app I built in lovable. Um and then of course of course the minute Nate and I talked he's he's like I want it in next.js because it was in view and uh >> so Ben no longer has any lovable heritage in it. >> Yeah, we did pull it back out. Yeah. Yeah. the uh he made me refactor the whole thing. >> We did. We had to ref I'm sorry about that. We had to refactor it. Um but this does call out something really cool I don't think people realize. One of the things that's cool in the age of AI is that it's easier to build things with fewer meetings. So this is the first time Jonathan and I are having a meeting and we are launching tomorrow. >> Yeah. Usually it's me posting like document after document after document and Nate saying, >> "Yeah, this is fine. I hate this. That's good. And then I'll hear from him two days later, you know. >> Yeah. Yeah. I'm like I'm like one of those slow inference LLMs. I eventually prickle back around hopefully with a high quality response. I I always ladder back to sort of why we do this and and I think one of the things that really excites me about AI cred is we haven't had any kind of product space where we can have a conversation about what overall fluency feels like and I am sure that AI cred will continue to evolve as folks give us feedback. One of the things I do want to call out on that note is that Jonathan and I are going to be opening up a Slack channel into our work Slack. So if you sign up for AI cred, you are going to be invited to join us in the work Slack and give us feedback directly. Um, so you can just ping us and say, "Hey, I got this weird response and I want this fixed or I have this cool idea for the leaderboard or whatever it is. Maybe it's a bug and we can just get right on fixing it." uh because I think that one of the things we want to model is that AI tooling evolves and so we build AI cred but we're building it for a space that's evolving and so AI cred will evolve to keep pace with how learning continues to need to grow in the age of AI. Yeah, there just to double down on that, definitely join the Slack. I I I implemented this whole bug report system. You could use that. I did rate limited at two per hour. I don't want people spamming me, but um but definitely join the Slack. Uh this this is going to like oh man, in two months you're going to hear all kinds of updates that are implementing really really cool features. There there's a lot of stuff that I don't want to talk about now because it probably, you know, you never know if it'll actually happen and I want to get your open >> there there's so many cool things coming. This is just going to constantly improve and and yeah, we definitely need people's input. Like, you know, my 12-year-old son is the reason the profile pages are actually going to look good. So >> everyone like >> yeah your feedback is super important. >> Um and of course uh for folks this came out of the substack community. So we want to give back to the Substack community. So if you are a member of the Substack you're going to get a screaming Black Friday discount on this. Um and that's because this is one of the products that got born out of the chat, right? Like we want to make sure that it feels like it's part of the community. Um >> don't join the Substack. Sorry D. Don't join the Substack to get a discount on this. Join the Substack because like genuinely the people the people that I've met in this space, the people that have helped me like that. >> Shoot. We have Shank who's >> Yeah. >> who who's a huge head engineer. I I don't even know. I can't even pronounce some of their titles. like these people are like top level engineers and software developers and people who run actually large companies and you know you know Nate's Christmas tree farmer from earlier you know like there are so so many just genuinely absolutely amazing people um and then there's me but yeah um join anyway >> yeah no I >> it was a weird attempt at self-deprecation but Yeah, I don't know. The community is a reason. Like I and I I am genuinely shocked. Like it's something I really appreciate is that this community has just grown up organically and now I just watch the chat and I'm like it's not me answering everything, right? It's people responding to each other which is always what you want with a community because it's like this many to many connection and it feels really strong. So I've just I love that. >> Yeah. Yeah. I I totally agree. And uh definitely sign up for AI cred, get your fluency. I want to see I have an 8.9 right now. I I'm pretty sure you can't get more than a nine. >> First evaluation. So it's is it might be a little tough to beat me, but >> h someone needs to go beat John. I want to see the leaderboard tomorrow. All right. Thank you, Jonathan. This has been great. >> Same. All right. Cheers.
