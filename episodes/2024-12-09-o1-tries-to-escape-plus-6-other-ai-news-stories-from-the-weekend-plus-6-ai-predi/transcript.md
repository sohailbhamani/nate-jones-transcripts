# o1 tries to escape plus 6 other AI news stories from the weekend plus 6 AI predictions for this week

seven pieces of AI news and six predictions for the week ahead number one the alignment numbers from Red teaming for open ai1 model came out and they are 98% fine and 2% somewhat concerning specifically when red teams presented open ai's 01 model with simulated dialogue between Engineers talking about shutting down the model the model's response was to go and try and exfiltrate its weights 2% of the time and what I mean by that is that tried to steal its weights which are the numerical patterns that you developed during training that make the model what it is and it tried to escape now that was exactly what the red team scenario was trying to see would occur and it did 2% of the time open AI has decided that is safe enough to release and I guess we'll all find out number two uh somebody somebody leaked uh Sora so not the full model but leaked a video showing what Sora can now do and is absolutely astonishing the character consistency in particular is really incredible and I I saw a leak of essentially what looked like a Hollywood movie about Vikings with consistent characters and it felt it felt tiny in a way I Can't Describe there is an uncanny valley aspect to the human characters in particular that may get solved over time to me when I I look at it none of these characters are going to be getting Oscars anytime soon I don't worry about the replacement of people as actors per se but I do think it's going to be absolutely incredible for creators it's going to make the bar for creating short film way way way way lower than it is so we will see there's rumors that will drop today to the public not just as a leak number three uh super base is coming to bolt which is nice for Builders uh I think there were ways to sort of hook it in before but it's coming in atively and that's nice because most projects have a back end and having super bay sort of more baked in will help number four yeah one two three 4 open AI uh has showed Anderson Cooper advanced voice inv Vision mode I don't know if you caught that but basically you can hold your phone camera up and then use advanced voice mode and you can talk to like what the camera sees and it can talk back and it can see it so that's pretty cool number five just two weeks ago uh the the researchers that be declared that the New York Times connections puzzles where you group four words semantically were impossible to solve uh by large language models and lo and behold 01 Pro came out and 01 Pro solved it we really need to stop making these predictions uh number six if you upgrade this is just a tip but it came out over the weekend as people saw their billing statements if you upgrade from plus to Pro at the very end of your billing cycle you get a pro-rated rate for pro which means means you don't pay $200 like if you upgrade three days before the end of the cycle you pay 20 bucks for pro just a pro tip all right uh and then the last piece of news uh Gemini released a 2 million token context window Gemini 1206 which is just incredible and I find it especially ironic because Sundar gave an interview the CEO of Google gave an interview declaring that the lwh hanging fruit in AI is gone on December 4th before 1206 dropped from his own company with a 2 million token context window and before all of this dropped over the weekend uh as far as AI news goes yes that all these seven items that that I just ripped through those came out over the weekend basically okay what's up next six things that are up next we we I'm trying to figure out like what is open AI coming out with a lot of other people are these are these are my best guesses as to what's left in open ai's 12 days of open a I think Sora is coming I think the advanced voice and vision mode that was just mod Anderson Cooper is dropping I think 3D modeling in some form is dropping where the llm can interact with a 3D model I think project spaces are coming so that's the idea that Claude already has where you like organize uh your your work into projects in open AI I think something to do with agents is coming I'm not sure what it is but right now it's just an API framework I think it's going to be much more than that uh and then last but not least I think that they're going to drop GPT 4.5 or GP pt5 I'm not sure which I don't know what they'll call it their naming conventions are weird and the reason that's important and again they don't make this clear but GPT 4.5 or5 is a different way of gaining intelligence than 01 is so GPT 4.5 or five is a large language model trained in the traditional way over an immense data set and producing results based on training and that's different from 01 which partly Depends for Intelligence on compute at test time where you speak into or you type into the chat and it goes away and it thinks about it and comes back and the length of that thinking time allows it to run multiple parallel paths and then come back with an answer that it feels his best both of those kinds of intelligence are important they have separate scaling laws I think that just as they launched with 01 on the first day it is possible that they will launch with 4.5 or five on the last day the 12 days we will see I do not expect that to be immediately obvious because they have already screwed up these these launches it's very confusing the names are confusing I'll try and help it be as clear as possible in my reporting on it okay so those are seven things that that are news plus six predictions it's going to be a wild week ahead cheers
