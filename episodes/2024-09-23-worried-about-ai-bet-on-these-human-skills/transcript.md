# Worried about AI? Bet on these human skills

if you're wondering what skills are going to persist in a world of AI I would challenge you to think about what skills are most valuable for human in-person interaction those kinds of skills are not going to go away and yes they can be transferable to remote work environments Etc but the thing to call out is there are certain modalities of Being Human that AI is not very good at I'll give you an example recipes AI can make recipes but pretty consistently so far in blind taste tests humans prefer human generated recipes AI tends to overemphasize a particular flavor profile AI tends to be less nuanced and I believe this is because AI doesn't have an effective feedback loop AI doesn't taste AI doesn't bake something and say m this cookie isn't quite right it's just a little bit dry let me see if I can modify it humans do and the best human chefs are going to be repeating and getting that feedback loop going with their own taste Buzz with the taste buds of their customers until they get something exactly right that doesn't mean we're all going to become chefs in the age of AI but I think it's a good example I'll give you another example AI is better and better and better at medical diagnosis every single model so far released in 2024 has been incrementally better 01 was a big jump in medical diagnosis capabilities that doesn't mean that we're using it for medical diagnosis but it does mean that it is getting better and better at answering medical diagnosis type questions accurately and with that in mind I think that we are going to start to see a shift over the next 10 15 years toward registered nurses and nursing type professions as being very very valuable for humans because the human presence matters a lot in providing medical care but the actual diagnosis we may be getting to a point where the AI is actually better at diagnosing humans with diseases than doctors are and so again it's a situation where you might think that the doctor is the one that retains the power in the scenario because doctors have more knowledge doctors have to go to school for more years it's not necessarily true I think we're getting to a point where the value of incremental knowledge is not necessarily is obvious because the AI can learn so quickly could the AI do a doctor's job today from a diagnosis perspective not quite not really in five years I wonder I wonder and if that's the case then that's going to put value back on bedside manner it's going to put value back on humans being kind and caring and the health care experience things that the AI just is not going to be able to do as effectively the robots that come and care for you are not going to provide the level of human care and concern that a person can so when I think about that I also think about the professional world where can we look in our professional lives for human skills that are going to stay with us this is part of what I'm covering in the uh Ai and careers course that I'm doing on Maven if you look at your career as a series of investments in long-term payouts from a skill perspective I believe that there are strong long-term payouts still ahead for human skills and I think the technical skills are leaning more on AI intelligence allocation and they're leaning more on how you think about applying artificial intelligence to business problems that have a human component for instance the AI might have thought that Google's ads describing a child using a large language model to write to their favorite track star in the Olympics would be a good idea it's topical it talks about the capabilities of a large language model correctly and accurately it's got a cute kid angle but as a human it really fell flat it fell flat because we associate the idea of writing a letter to a star from a kid as a uniquely human activity where we can see the kid using the pencil to form the letters and they're doing their very best and it just didn't work and eventually Google had to pull the ad in those situations the human perspective on what humans like and what humans want is going to remain critical I'll also go into the technical side of things I think that there will remain a ton of value in humans understanding and architecting large software systems over time so if you're in the developer space perhaps the value of pumping out code that is often written before and therefore in training models is going down but the value of solving novel problems as an engineer in an efficient way is something I think that will take longer for the AI to effectively address and I suspect that that is because humans have particular behavioral needs that other humans understand at scale and can best represent with engineering practices so if you're trying to understand how cdns actually respond during a prime time football streaming event which is something we had to deal with at Prime video that is going to depend on a knowledge that people are more likely to tune in and start streaming the game if it is close if it is in the fourth quarter if it is going to overtime things like that whereas from an llm perspective from an AI perspective even if it's not an llm all you're going to see is a series of previous traffic Events maybe that's enough maybe that's enough to design the system but I would challenge you and I would say You're going to to get better systems long term with that human perspective with an understanding of why the software is being used the way it is so there you go just a few little thoughts that I had on how humans can build long-term durable skills and areas where humans are continuing to Excel and I think are likely to continue to excel in the age of AI where we have feedback loops that are uniquely human we are going to remain strong contenders for highly skilled workers professions places where we can add value to the market and that doesn't mean by the way that I don't see a lot of potential for AI of course I do it just means that we need to learn where is AI going to be good and where is AI going to be good by working with us so on to the Brave New World Together
