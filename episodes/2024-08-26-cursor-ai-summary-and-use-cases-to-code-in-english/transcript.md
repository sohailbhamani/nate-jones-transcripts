# Cursor AI: Summary and Use-Cases to Code in English

the news over the weekend was all about cursor. a no it's not a square word c RS o r this is an AI code editing tool that devs are just absolutely raving about I'll tell you some of the folks talking about it they're really big names uh in a couple minutes here it really focuses on being able to enable the actual workf flows the developers are already using to go faster and so they demo right on the site is showing you hey parallelize this API so it goes faster um or hey could you help me find like a tab to autocomplete this piece of code that I'm working on for a component and you just tab through and a sort of autocompletes based on the structure that you have so the idea is as a developer you already have an idea of what to build you just want something that helps you extend your thought pattern and go quicker and so it's taking this concept of an engineer who thinks clearly and can Design Systems and separating that from who is writing the code and now cursor is writing the code and the engineers are still doing the thinking this is caught on so Andress carpy who is a co-founder at open AI or who was a co-founder at open AI used to be a director of AI at Tesla is now a Founder over at his own edtech startup he tweeted over the weekend that he is now using cursor for a lot of his programming he's programming in English effectively and cursor is just helping him to rip through that much much faster cursor exploded obviously like when if if a founder of open AI is willing to say this it's a big deal why combinator is talking about the fact that most of their Founders many of their Founders are using something like cursor AI for their coding so they're coding in English as well aws's CEO again over the weekend this news broke gave a fireside chat saying if you go forward 24 months from now or some amount of time I can't exactly predict where it is it's possible that most developers are not coded that now looks like it might be late we may be doing that sooner and then just to round it all off uh sahil lavingia lavingia I'm actually not sure of how to pronounce his last name uh CEO at gumroad also has an entire YouTube series up on how to code with cursor that is how fast this is breaking people are talking about this as a chat GPT moment specifically for coding and yes they're comparing it to other things like co-pilot and they're saying this isn't close like cursor is so much better and when I look at that I see how deeply embedded it is in developer workflows it doesn't require you to change your workflow it just helps you get your work done faster and I think that is a real clue to where are the products that are going to really break through for AI take what you already do make it tremendously better easier faster and just get out of the way and that's what cursor's focused on to the point where a guy like Amar Rishi head of design at 11 Labs can do a Twitter thread over the weekend saying I am coding a Mac app I have never coded before I'm using cursor follow me as I do so right he's going to just sort of live live uh tweet the entire thing and he's just the head of design right he's not a coder and that's how quickly things are changing so all of that to say if you haven't played with cursor yet what's stopping you from playing with cursor
