# Can OpenAI Win at Search?

All right, I want to do one of those rare Nate shows the screen videos because I want to talk about something that I think is getting solved that hasn't really been properly solved until now. We've talked about chat GPT and other large language models disrupting search, but I feel like we are at the point where you can reasonably shift a lot of the search value out of Google and that is a big big deal. I'm not saying tomorrow that Google has no value and I'm not saying Google doesn't respond. I'm well aware that the cost curve on serving LLMs is dominated by Google. Google has some very sharp minds working on LLMs, but the cost to disrupt their own core search experience is not something I'm sure they're willing to bear because as you can see here, this is an LLM search results page that has no ads. That does not suit Google's business model and yet it's very useful. I just threw a few uh queries we're going to, run, through., I'm, a, Michigan fan. Can you find me Michigan tickets for next season? I'd love to see the Ohio State game. So, I see the game time, the date, the venue. It's going to be at home at Michigan Stadium. It gives me the average price. It then sort of goes beyond that. This is a very 03 thing to do. Tells me how to lock in the tickets. Gives me different strategies. Gives me tips to go to the game in Ann Arbor. gives me a pick list of next steps. I tell you what, 03 has the highest bias for action of any model I've seen. It's higher than my bias for action. And that is saying something. And I say, great. I love this. Uh, can you get me Smart Flights from Seattle for this game? What are my options? Now, this is really interesting because I'm deliberately trying to push it. I would not say this is as good as Google Flights by any means, but I think it's enough that it is going to disrupt some of the top offunnel search as chat GPT awareness begins to spread. You have to realize, you know, I get 03 now because I'm paying for pro, but in 6 months, everyone's going to have lots and lots of O3. And this kind of experience is going to be possible for everybody at scale. And with that in mind, this kind of strategic here's your options to think about is super useful and frankly in some ways easier to sort through than the wall of flights that Google provides. Again, no ads here. deeply disruptive of Google's business. So then it gives me the smart booking moves. It gives me the strategy. Google doesn't do any of this. It gives me ground and logistics tips. Again, Google's just trying to sell me rental cars to to buy at this point. Um, and then I I deliberately switch it up. I'm like, "Okay, let's try a health one. What are some quick exercises I can do to improve my back health?" Because this is one of those things where like I don't just want to fall into the trap of being like, "Oh yeah. booking flights. That's why people use Google. People use Google for lots of other stuff. So, I wanted to give a real rant here. So, I think the the weakness here where I think that OpenAI can and probably will improve is there's no like demo video, no diagram. Now Google's a bit disorganized, but I will say their image search and so on will get you diagrams of all these exercises in the first click. And that's something that's missing here that I anticipate OpenAI is going to close, which is the other reason to do an exercise like this periodically. It basically gives you a cheat sheet into what OpenAI is going to be thinking about from a product perspective because Sam is very vocally going after Google's cake um and wants to grab that search spot. But even without the without the diagrams, this is already very useful. I have clear names. I have reps. I have quick form cues, which is actually very difficult to get on Google. I have a how to use it in one clear place. It's that clarity of like a single answer that's opinionated that I think that Google is really missing. And I know they're trying it with the Google summaries. It's just not as effective. All right, I now go to the I can't remember this and it's complete my knowledge kind of query. This is my favorite version. Uh, I can't remember a movie I was watching. It had a kid in it that was like a robot. He flew in like an SR71 or something across the US and the kid was part human. It was really old from the 80s. It's Daryl. D A R Y L. Um, and yes, I did remember the plane correctly, which shows you how much of a nerd I am. Uh, it just retrieves it like that. This kind of query is kind of funky for Google to retrieve. Sometimes you get it, sometimes you don't. I do get better results reliably with LLMs because it just pattern matches across their pre-training data with natural language in a way that like the standard Google search just doesn't do as well typically. Then moving on, last query I think I threw up here. What's my best approach to getting into the whole AI vibe coding space if I am a beginner? Now, you'll notice as I go through here that I am using what I would call Nate prompts. I'm doing a little bit more language here. I It's hard for me to stop myself doing that at this point. Like I know how LLMs work. I know that works better as a query. The jury is very much out on whether people are going to tolerate longer queries to get results that are more meaningful to them. I know that people are using Chad GPT a lot. My guess is that is going to bleed into search as openAI is able to make search more relevant and meaningful and seamless a part of the LLM experience. As an example, I get people who are asking me why does chat GPT not understand chat GPT's own plans? Well, the answer is the pre-training data doesn't include current models and it would have to search. But that's a very easy search thing and it would feel really seamless and it would be one of those examples of search being really useful in the model for people who are typing very quick queries like what's in chat gpt free. All right, moving on. Uh it gives me a practical path to coding. It talks about the stack. This gets in over my head. So let's just assume I am much more of a beginner than all of this. Um, so I'm going to actually do this live here. Let's assume I am 9 years old. Uh, please dial back and give me a beginner friendly approach. Now, this gets at the one weakness that I think they're going to have to fix. This is slow. It's good search, but it tends to be slow. This is the fastest response I had in this whole query string. And I think it's because it's reasoning off of a pre prior response. So it's quicker. So it gives me like specific recommendations. Um which I think are really great actually. Like it's super helpful. Might use this with my kid. Um gives me support and safety. Encourages me to have a grown-up, which sounds great. Um I love this tip. If something feels confusing, say pause and ask for help. That's what real engineers do every day. I think that's just a fantastic little moment. And uh it gives me encouragement that spending just 15 minutes really helps. So my point here is that search is at the point in LLMs where it is potentially disruptible if they can bring this kind of quality of search down across the free tier. And I want to flag it now. I want to get what your guys' thoughts are. I would be worried if I were Google. I don't think it's going to, be, easy, to, compete, with, OpenAI at this point. They have all the momentum. They have the ability to distribute to their whatever 6 7 800 million I lose track. It's going to hit a billion by the end of the year active users. And that search experience if it starts to peel away search volume, it could look like a sigmoid curve where it peels away a little bit initially and then it just falls off a cliff. uh if they can actually crack the nut on product adoption for basic everyday searches which I guarantee you there are teams at OpenAI working on. What's your thought? Are we at a point where we are close to a tipping point on
