# Here's the next billion dollar LLM startup idea

you know whenever we have a major breakthrough technologically we tend to unlock a stream of Downstream use cases so for example when Amazon figured out how to sell Goods over the Internet we unlocked a host of startups and businesses that figured out how to sell on Amazon when Shopify did the same thing e-commerce exploded because tools were easier for people who were good at making and selling things but were not necessarily good at internet sales because Shopify took that problem away we now have the same thing with llms en coding so llms are just at the point now where it is becoming popular to use llms to code up an app and I have talked with experienced developers I've worked on coded Enterprises I know that coding an app in 30 minutes in cursor with an llm or in repet is not the same thing thing is building production code and one of the things that I think is really interesting is that I don't I don't infer from that that we will not be getting llms who are capable of getting to production code eventually what I infer from that is that we have a host of startup opportunities that are on the horizon now we have for the first time got maybe 100x more people interested in coding over the next couple years years than we have had ever before and we have a lot of developers coding now but because the coding bar has dropped to zero because my eight-year-old can code in English now we have options for getting people engaged with the profession of engineering that we just never had and that presents a whole host of Downstream challenges because the things that people assume developers had to know to be developers is it's just no longer true and so we have to sort of think through and say what does it mean to be a good engineer writing production code we kind of know what that looks like now I'm not saying it's going to change in the next 90 days because these things do take time but I think there is a whole host of billion dooll startup ideas around taking this idea of simple English instructions to drive code and figuring out how to take what is essentially a prototype you can knock together in a few minutes and convert that into something that is structured that is scalable that is sustainable from an engineering perspective and that fits well into your existing code base massive opportunity there there's opportunity for easier deployments there's opportunity for easier uh and more translatable uh error checking if you're going through and sort of doing a poll request review there's opportunity for easier um Edge case finding actually I think that's one of the things that is a product person person I really it drives me nuts like we will get through the poll request we'll get to code complete and then something that was an edge case that should have been in the technical plan from the start pops up because we just didn't anticipate that the code would touch this particular corner of the experience in this way because of this unplanned interaction and now we have to go back and fix that bug now we may have to refactor a bit it will add two weeks I have been in those shoes multiple times in my career in fact almost every quarter I get into something like that because frankly code is hard holding a mental model of code is really hard and this is going to make it easier like llms longterm are going to make a lot of that easier they are not making it easier today and I think one of the interesting thing is we are we tend to look at the present State and say this is what it's going to be like llms do not write good production code today I don't blame any developer who says this is spaghetti code this is a disaster this is not something I want touching my production environment fine it will be it will be and I think one of the reasons it will be is that what a developer looks like is going to change gen Alpha my kids age they're going to come up and they don't care what we used to call being a developer frankly they don't care what we used to call being a product manager they're just going to come up and say I can build this I'm going to build it and that massive expectation from that market is going to drive startups and I don't think we'll have to wait until until they get to be like 5 10 years from now until they get to be ready to enter the job market I think it's just going to be in the next couple years we're going to see a bunch of startups crop up that figure out how to take these increasingly smart llms and get them to play nicely with production code architecture so that they act as effective agents and they write within the expectations of a technical environment that is ready for scale so we will see but to me when I look at the current crop of apps and by the way I don't know if you've noticed this is a little Easter egg for those of you sticking around all those guys that did like I can build an app in 30 minutes they didn't do I can sustain the app I can bug fix the app they didn't do I can show you how to make this app go to you know a million people served and I can add V2 features it's always just the Prototype because that's what llms are good at right now and I just noticed that because like there's this Rush of people doing this in repet and incursor in the last two weeks and it's kind of dried up it's like a trend right but the building will continue people will continue to discover coding this way and I think the opportunities for startups to actually get from this rough idea of English to code and move from that to refined code structures that work well with your existing production environment that's a YY idea in fact that's probably something people are already building if you know someone building that already you can just pop them down under the comments um and I'm really excited to see it because I think that this is going to be one of those things where we're going to have you know 100x more builders in the space and we're going to have a much much richer software environment as a result so we will see but development is changing
