# Microsoft's 100B Deal with OpenAI Means Microsoft May Control Superintelligence

Microsoft has a 100 billion reasons to decide when AGI or artificial general intelligence is achieved that's right they agreed on a hundred billion dollar as the number that open AI has to hit in profits before the board of open AI will certify that artificial general intelligence has been achieved now most of the time when we think about what does it take for an AI to achieve general intelligence we don't think to ourselves how much money has it made lately but that's what Microsoft is thinking that's what Sacha nadela is thinking and I went and looked you may not know this I didn't know this when I looked I wanted to know how many companies in history have made a hundred billion dollar or more in profits over the course of the lifetime of the firm there's not very many Amazon crossed that that hundred billion doll number just a year or two ago after 25 years in business Saudia ramco has done it Berkshire Hathaway has done it Apple has done it yes Microsoft has done it too in fact the estimate for Microsoft is I think it's something like $700 billion over the course of the entire history of Microsoft and so if you look at sacha's bet here he's saying yeah you can say that artificial general intelligence has been achieved and get it done and reshape your relationship with Microsoft after you get to100 billion in profits that would be adding like another eighth to the total profits generated by Microsoft ever in its history of course Sacha wants to cut that deal and so to me what that says is that open AI is desperate for servers they're desperate for time they're desperate for support they need the partnership that Microsoft is bringing them in order to scale or they would not have cut this deal at the end of the day this is an extremely Microsoft favorable deal the Microsoft lawyers were all over this one as Sacha himself hinted in his interview a few weeks ago when he said that we're above around Below open AI That's code for we've got them surrounded they cut an incredible deal and the the reason all of this Matters by the way is that the original terms that Microsoft negotiated with open AI are that when general intelligence is achieved open AI can to some extent shift the value of that general intelligence into something that benefits Humanity more largely and they aren't obligated to continue to return as many of the profits to Microsoft is possible I think it's said 75% or something of the profits go to Microsoft for the duration of the partnership until AGI is achieved that was left nicely undefined until now when Microsoft wanted to put a definition to it and I think part of why Sacha wanted to rush this in 2024 is he sees the writing on the wall he sees how fast the team at open AI is developing intelligence he doesn't want to wait around and have an even more complicated convers ation next year he wanted to close this out and so what he did was he said we need a Line in the Sand we need to negotiate this cleanly and the cleanest line is financial and conveniently the cleanest Financial line is extremely favorable to Microsoft now you can stretch a point and squint at it and say I guess it's general intelligence if it does $100 billion worth of profitable work maybe that's what the lawyers were arguing but to me it seems like an extremely stretched definition of general intelligence and one that's extremely Microsoft favorable and given the very very short list of companies maybe 10 total in the world that have generated a hundred billion dollars or more over the course of the firm's life open AI is going to have to get extremely lucky just to get to that number ever it is quite possible that we will be in a world where open AI is sucking up chips sucking up data centers spending like crazy to BU build and they will hit their burn rate and it will be so high they will not be in any position to generate massive profits for a parent company for a long time to come if ever it is extremely unusual for any company ever in the history of the world to hit a hundred billion do why would open AI be different yes they may have stumbled upon intelligence but the cost of innovation remains high and they may not actually be in the best position to harvest the value there so we will have to see but to me this looks like a Microsoft favorable deal that tells me that open AI is pretty desperate right now they had to cut this deal let me know what you think is the correct definition of general intelligence hundred billion doll yes no I don't think it is
