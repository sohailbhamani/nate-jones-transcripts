# OpenAI is thinking about building a robot—why that would be a risky bet

one of the big questions in AI has been to what extent physical form factors are going to be tackled by the model makers which is a fancy way of saying will open AI do robotics will Google do robotics will meta do robotics we do have some of the answer we've seen what I would call breadcrumbs along the way in 2024 to suggest that open AI is strongly considering robotics they have hired some of the best physical device designers in the world including Johnny IV who used to work on design at Apple they are supposedly exploring making a wearable with Johnny we will see no prototype has yet leaked and just a couple of days ago news broke that they are seriously thinking about building robots again and I say again because they actually shut down their robot division in 2021 this was really before chat GPT caught on you remember when 3.5 came out this is not something that you would allow to drive a robot it wasn't making those kinds of decisions and now chat GPT is actually inside other company's robots for example figure which is shipping robots to factories now uses chat GPT in the brains of the robot it's natural if you're a CEO in Sam alman's position to think to yourself would it make sense for my company to get into robotics should I reawaken the robotics division well that's an interesting interesting question I think one of the bigger pieces they need to tackle is whether they as a company strategically are willing to play from behind I've been in a company that plays from behind Amazon was a rare second place player in video when I was there in Prime video Netflix dominated it was a very strange feeling to be in an otherwise dominant company and to be playing in a second place division that was working on catching up that is what would be happening in robotics at open AI unlike the rest of the company where open AI enjoys an advantage and is widely considered one of the leaders in the AI space it's a very different thing and it's very very difficult and takes a long time to catch up in those situations so I don't know if they're actually going to invest in robotics I am much more confident that they will invest in some kind of physical device it makes too much sense for them not to be in the physical world since so much of the customers interaction with AI is going to be in the physical space you might as well own the device and so I feel good about predicting that they will get into physical devices robots may be one way they do that but they may find it easier just to work with Johnny IV and get into wearables or something like that we will see either way I think my base case bet is we see some kind of a prototype before the end of next year before the end of 2025 you tell me what you think
