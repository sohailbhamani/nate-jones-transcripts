# AI News Today: OpenAI Strawberry Capabilities Leak + 3 More AI Stories from Apple, Anthropic, Google

AI can give you so much in news it's hard to keep up here's four things that happened just in the past couple of days number one is strawberry information so strawberry if you're not familiar with the rumor mail is what everyone is calling open ai's new large language model intelligence project it used to be called Q or qar and they renamed it to Strawberry I guess it's more friendly anyway the idea that dropped this time the rumor that dropped this time this is in the information I'll link it is that this is a model focused on novel reasoning non hallucinatory results and complex multi-step problem solving and there is a big drawback we are so used to the chat GPT 40 model of instantaneous responses that everyone sort of assumes that one of the implicit constraints at chat GPT is they will keep the speed as they increase the intelligence that's according to the rumors apparently proving very difficult and they're now trying to figure out can we compress this large model into something smaller and more performant that we can put into a chat window to meet people's expectations or not and one of the options could be that they could choose to give you two options right do I want the correct answer slowly or do I want the approximate answer quickly and and you might think oh we always go for the correct answer or maybe you think you always go for the fast answer but I bet you there's people on both sides of the fence there and I think that's part of what's interesting about this entire discussion there is no free lunch here we are increasing intelligence but increasing intelligence at the cost of usability and this is kind of getting back to one of my fundamental thesis around sort of the path to artificial general intelligence which is that eventually we may get to a spot where these machines are able to do really complex problem solving tasks truly novel problems strawberry may be a leap in that direction it's apparently been demoed to the National Security establishment in the United States already perhaps it will be right it'll be a step in that direction potentially but even if it is I'm not sure how useful it will be day to day if it's slow if you were already used to working with chat GPT as a fallible Junior intern someone who makes a lot of mistakes and by the way I've known interns much better than Chad GPT so that is not a knock on interns at all if you're already used to working with it as something fallible and you check what it does and you get instantaneous responses it's actually a whole new workflow it's a whole new problem space to go back and say what problems do I have that are complex enough I would want it to run a long time maybe I set the prompt up and I run it overnight and I check check in the morning it doesn't even feel like the same piece of intelligence or intelligence allocation at that point it feels like two sets of intelligences and you have to sort of decide which one do I need for this problem and that gets back to the idea that fundamentally what we're going to need as a skill as humans in the new economy is the ability to allocate tasks across intelligences is this a human intelligence task and now is it a chat GPT 4 for model type intelligence task or is it potentially a strawberry type intelligence task where you need that sort of multi-step reasoning on the first try and and the key thing is this not so many problems are actually in that multip reasoning process you you may think that there's a ton of them and maybe on a global scale there's a lot of meaningful difficult multistep problems to be solved but from a pure knowledge worker in business persp perspective you're not solving novel multi-step reasoning problems all that frequently at work I've got news for you so we'll see that's the rumor mail I'll link the information uh leak article or inferred rumor article or you know we'll all see when it actually comes out article underneath the YouTube here three other things to quickly get to uh Gemini released another model no one is paying attention to Gemini and they just keep giving you free tokens and so if you're a developer Gemini is a great one to build with like that there's just so much free usage that they give you I think it's in the billions now in tokens Claude uh released artifacts which are their sort of Standalone little like new UI where they like write something in the side of the pain and like you can work with it separately from the main conversation I find it really useful and that's now out on iPhone and last but not least speaking of iPhones uh apparently Apple intelligence is delayed that came out a couple weeks ago but what came out recently is that iPhone is still going to have iPhone 16 is still going to have some features of artificial intelligence it's just not clear what is it a hardware feature is it a software feature it's not clear so we will see the main news is strawberry that's what I put at the top uh what did I miss tell me what you think of strawberry what would you use multi-step reasoning for that's the question that I'm thinking about
