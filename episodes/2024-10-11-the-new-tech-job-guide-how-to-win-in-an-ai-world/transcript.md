# The New Tech Job Guide: How to Win in an AI World

you know the core of our job market problem right now in Tech is that we have predicated all of Tech for 40 or 50 years on the idea that knowledge is something that is hard to gain and it's not anymore knowledge is easy to gain and I want to take a minute to step back to look at how we've architected our entire job career ladder job structure our whole Focus as an industry on how we develop talent look at how we've done it before and then look at what needs to shift so this is a strategic conversation about why tech jobs are hard right now and what we can do to prepare for a world where it's going to fundamentally shift so let's look first at what the previous date was before Chad GPT hit the scene for a long time as long as I've had my career just about for anyone else who's a graveyard in Tech we've had a fundamental bifurcation Tech there's two categories there's technical roles and there's non-technical roles those are predicated on knowledge gain and the difficulty of knowledge gain and Technical roles for years and years and years and years being a software development engineer virtually required a computer science degree certainly did when I was coming through college in the early 2000s and if you are getting a CS degree you are going to be guaranteed a software development engineering job that was the implicit promise that was the promise when I was in college it was the promise for decades afterward and decades before like even back in the 90s and the in the 80s if you got a CS degree you were headed to a technical role of some kind because it was all hand done like the knowledge had to be acquired by hand you had to read Hamming you had to read textbooks you had to actually write code by hand you had to learn how functions worked you had to learn how to code a program that was reliable you had to learn how to design Technical Systems all of that stuff right you get the idea non-technical roles were different the expectation was that the knowledge that mattered was contextual knowledge about the product about stakeholder management about the customer and so you can group product management customer success roles sales roles marketing roles they all fall into this non-tech bucket and essentially everybody was specializing in pieces of the non-tech value chain and what they were specializing on was contextual knowledge of that corner of the domain right like the marketers knew what kind of marketing worked for a particular product in a b Toc Market aimed at a particular demographic and the sales guys knew what particular sales approaches worked for B2 to be account selling and the product people knew how to connect engineering requirements which are quite specific with customer requirements which are quite vague and so all of that to say for a long time we had this split the split began to break down in the 2015 to 2020 range and this is before Chad GPT so I want to actually call us back to this we started to have this idea of a technical product manager and a non-technical product manager and that was an early sign that this knowledge was starting to get blurry because PMS had been around Engineers so long that we had PMS in the job family who could code we had PMS in the job family who had acquired the technical knowledge needed to build extremely Technical Systems and we needed them to because the systems we were building at that point were built by hand there wasn't really an AI that was helping us build them but they were extremely Technical and extremely complex if you were driving personalization at Netflix it's a very technical role and you had to be a technical pm to do it successfully and so as our Technical Systems got more complex in the 2010s we had to have more technical product managers to make that work fast forward to when chat GPT was released and everything changed at that point the fundamental basis for that entire system of employment shifted we were now in a world we are now in a world where knowledge is a commodity knowledge used to be precious knowledge used to be something you went to college to gain and you paid like an absurd amount of money and it it has gotten more and more expensive and at this point one of the interesting things is even though College costs are going exponential the implied value of the knowledge you gain at a school has just fallen through the floor and no one really knows what to do with that dislocation this video is not about college cost unit economics we're g to put that to the side uh this is about talent in Tech and when knowledge gets commoditized what it means is the fundamental dichotomy between Tech and non-tech roles disappears like I will have people tell me Nate I'm not a technical person and I will say I don't care because you can have your best friend chat GPT make you a technical person in 30 seconds like there is almost no point now for example in saying we want a technical PM who can write SQL in Python because every PM can write SQL in Python now can they write it efficiently increasingly yes because the with proper prompting you can get efficient SQL and efficient python out of any llm it's not even a specific llm anymore chpt can do it Sonic can do it like it's just become commoditized and that's kind of my point you have a breakdown of Technical and non-technical skill skill sets and that means that the job creation ladder and the way we do Talent upleveling over time has changed because all of that was predicated on knowledge gain so if you think about the old way you would go to college you would get your degree maybe it was CS maybe it was something else and then you get an entry level role and the point of the entry-level role was to take all of this knowledge you had and basically show you how to apply it in the real world how do you write real life programs if you're an engineer how do you do real life program management or task management or CS if you are coming into an entry LEL role on the non-tech side and the idea was by gaining this knowledge of real world applications you would then be able to acquire enough experience and show you could solve problems in the real world enough to eventually earn a promotion and the problem now is that you don't really have any incentive to have those early rungs on the ladder in the organization chat GPT can do a lot of and so one of the things I've seen persistently is what happens to people who are early career what happens to people trying to break into Tech what happens to people who are just coming out of University how do they progress and I think that the key is understanding that we are no longer in an economy where knowledge is difficult to get and we're now in a world where showing that you can solve problems correctly is the new standard and we're still figuring out what that looks like as far as how resumés will change how applications will change it's early but fundamentally as an employer what people are looking for at the beginning of a career is show me that you can solve problems correctly in roughly this domain and show me that you've been able to deliver a little bit of impact there it's still a world where we recognize that you need more experience to deliver more impact but if you can come in and you can say I am already working in the B2B marketing space and this is what I already delivered on my own on the side here's a working piece of code that I put together with chat GPT and I got it up and running and look what I've solve for some marketers I'm making all of this up by the way but you get the idea it's not that everything has to be code generation and code portfolios I'm not trying to say that I'm trying to say that the focus from an employer is going to be on whether they can see that you can correctly solve problems because they know you can get the knowledge either way and so it's about your judgment it's not about the knowledge that you have and have brought to the table our application systems haven't caught up with that but I think that that also is a note of encouragement for us because I don't see a world where we don't need people with good judgment to solve problems I do see a world where people who assume that knowledge is still the coin of the realm right the currency we work in they're going to be in trouble because knowledge isn't hard anymore knowledge is easy it's about how you apply it that matters and so if you walk back into the job market like previously it was like okay so you have your Tech or non-tech degree you get an entry-level role you gain experience you get a mid-level role then if you show management aptitude you get a leadership role it's a very set pattern across a bunch of different job families now I suspect it's going to look different I think it's going to be show you can solve problems at the task level show you can solve problems correctly at the feature level so show you can solve problems correctly at the product level and finally show you can solve problems correctly at the business level that's going to be what people judge on and I think that one of the core questions if you're coming into Tech is how are you showing you can solve problems at what level are you operating at and how aggressive are you about scaling up and making sure that knowledge isn't a blocker because it doesn't have to be anymore you don't have to be blocked I saw a role just yesterday that was deliberately hiring for someone who would literally be a business in a box like this person would be product this person would be development this person would be marketing this person would be sales and they were operating within a larger platform they're not a Founder but they were taking this product end to end from idea to driving sales by themselves I think we're going to see more roles like that and so my my question for you is what kind of problems can you demonstrate that you've solved I'll leave it there let me know what do you think how's the how is the knowledge economy changing into the problem solving economy for lack of a better term cheers
