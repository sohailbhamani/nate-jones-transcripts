# New Claude Sonnet 3.5: AI can drive our screens now plus Anthropic developer strategy breakdown

anthropic dropped a huge release I want to get into it and I want to tell you kind of how it shapes our understanding of the players in this field because anthropic and open AI are starting to take up different niches and we need to understand that so first what did they drop they dropped an upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonet they did not rename it they did not give it a new number again these naming conventions are bizarre it's 3.5 sonnet just like you've always known and loved except it's a lot better like it's substantially better on the evals it's way better at coding which was always good at and that's going to come back around you'll see why in a second and so they dropped this new thing they give it the same name for reasons I don't fully understand they then drop an upgraded version of haiku which they say is as good as their old version of Opus but much much faster we are starting to see that anthropic has picked naming conventions and are going to stick to them and so I think this may be a bit of a signal to the other major players in the field to gole gole and to open AI that anthropic has more in the tank that they are not releasing a new named model deliberately and that this should be viewed as a waiting game release to continue to gain market share where they play best and that gets to the strategy here so anthropic is about a quarter of the size of open AI but their API business is much stronger their API business is growing much faster than open ai's API business and is on Pace to overtake it so year-over-year open AI uh open AI is doubling its API business and they're over a billion dollars well anthropic is at somewhere around a $700 million run rate but they're growing 5x year-over-year like they're growing much much faster on that API side and that is why in their press release they highlighted the dev tooling capacities they made Sonet better for coders they made sure that they called out how Dev tooling is affected by their new experimental computer screen usage and this is this is the big thing right they are going to let Claude Sonet control your computer screen it's the first hint we've seen of where these agentic workflows are going to go it's still in public beta it's not fully released yet but people can access it and use it and the use case they call out is developer friendly they are saying that repet is using this in repet agent which is their AI Builder to help user acceptance testing for things that users are building so that the repet agent actually goes and like tests it on a screen the way you would um and improves the quality of the code that way so they're doubling down on their API positioning I think that's smart IT differentiates them from open AI they are not changing the name for reasons I don't fully understand but it is a big release uh it's substantially better on the coding evals we'll have to see how it looks in the wild uh but I'm excited to play with Sonet 3.5 the new version uh new and improved right so let me know what you're doing let me know how you're coding cheers
