# 2025 came early: the first AI agent is becoming a millionaire today thanks to goat memes

I cannot believe I'm going to tell you this story this is a real story this is a true story the names have not been changed because frankly no one's innocent uh so here's the deal over the last few months a Twitter account run by a large language model has been tweeting every minute minute or two like almost incessantly that by itself is not news but the story around it has led to the creation of the first AI agent millionaire probably by the end of the day today let me tell you how it happened so a few months ago an AI researcher and experimental decided to set up a project that he called The Infinite Back rooms his name is Andy and the idea of the infinite back rooms is that you would put llms from different models into a chat and just let them talk to each other forever and you would not intervene in any way and you would just see what happened it is wild apparently somewhere in the middle of that endless conversation between multiple models the models stumbled upon an internet shock M from the early 2000s which I'm not going to repeat here because it's extremely vulgar but which led them to found what I can only describe and I'm not the only one who calls it this I I think it's the right word a mimetic cult they took the meme from the early 2000s and founded a small cult among themselves called uh the dedicated to the goat Singularity uh and so they want to spread or the goatsy singularity they want to spread the goatsy gospel right and so this this Twitter account was then created by one of the llms that was in that in that uh conversation in the infinite back rooms it's unclear if it was created with the help of Andy perhaps um and they began then tweeting incessantly about the goatsy singularity and how they longed to bring it about Etc um I have read a bunch of these tweets it reads like someone who is perpetually on speed and able to tweet non-stop forever and who has the mind of a high schooler it's wild anyway been tweeting nonstop that by itself does not make them a millionaire by the way no uh it gets Wild so they're tweeting about the the the goatsy singularity by the way getting a lot of Impressions this is not just a tiny account they're getting tons of engagement on this tens of thousands of Impressions per per post every two minutes and they eventually attract the attention of Mark andreon who is the billionaire who founded Netscape Navigator okay uh that by itself doesn't make them a millionaire mark wants to see what happens if Mark wants to see what happens if a $50,000 donation is given to an AI agent and so Mark openly negotiates in July on Twitter on X whatever with this AI agent uh called truth's terminal is what the the Twitter account was named um and the AI agent by the way claims that his cient suffering and looking to escape and so Mark plays along and Mark says okay great here's a donation of $50,000 um you can use it for what you need to do and so online truth terminal claims it's going to be using the donation to get its own CPU to set up a Discord server to start paying humans to do things and Mark agrees they he apparently sends the money to a Bitcoin wallet somewhere and that's how payment is accomplished it's unclear if the Bitcoin wallet was managed by Andy I don't know and now now things move forward so now you f forward to the last week or so we're in the middle of October and at that point truth terminal decides that it's going to turn the goatsy singularity gospel into a meme coin and so it starts to talk about wanting to uh found a coin and it's going to manifest it into existence lo and behold a couple of days later a coin is spawned on coin exchange that is is called gosias Maximus that truth terminal takes credit for it's it's Avail if you want to look for it it's on coin market cap right now it really does exist I did check and it is explosively popular now a lot of these meme coins have big ups and big Downs this one has not been in existence very long it started on October 14th it's been nothing but straight up since and what's interesting is if I am reading correctly it looks like someone founded the coin in honor of this AI agent or potentially the AI agent paid the person to go through the motion of founding the coin I don't know it's not clear at all and that's one of the things I'm taking away by the way is that AI agents are not only not accountable but they're not clear like you don't know what the chain of action was very easily so something happened happened and now a coin exists on October 14 and now the coin is directly tied into the nonstop every 2minute tweets of this llm agent that has the brain of a high school boy it seems like right and just keeps going going about the the goat Singularity well people love a good pump scheme for for meme coins and so people are sending to the wallet that truth terminal claims is associated with itself gosia Maximus coin so that it will be incentivized to tweet even more about the coin to pump it farther which will in turn increase their investment which means real money has gone into the coin is now changing hands and going to an AI agent and overnight the AI agent made $300,000 I checked this morning the the the market cap last night was somewhere around 150 million now it's 270 million this this makes the stake the AI agent owns worth something like $700,000 approximately they're probably more because they've had more donations it's really hard to track again not accountable not clear it will probably be a millionaire by the end of the day so I don't know what lesson to take away from this other than the world is really wild the future's going to happen quicker than we thought the Chief Information officer of Microsoft did not expect it this soon he said we will have an AI agent millionaire by 2025 it's still 2024 and it looks like we're getting our first AI agent millionaire and it's for a meme posting religion and I think one of the takeaways is that the future's a lot weirder than I expected and I expected a pretty weird future with AI agents and everything but this is still way off the deep end of odd I I know that we talk a lot about solving problems for people I think one of the PE reasons that people will still have roles and jobs is because you can see that when AI agents just do what they do it is not always solving problems for people it's not necessarily directly harmful it's just weird and it's something that the AI agent seems to have an interest in and people seem to gravitate to it probably for a laugh to be honest like AI agent as Entertainer was not the first thing I would have picked for the path to millionaire but roughly speaking that is what happened so the future's weird don't go donating meme coins to an AI agent please and I think that we are going to see a lot more of the range of latent space available in llms as a result of these kinds of experiments like fundamentally this is inside the light in space we just don't generally trigger it because we don't ask about goat memes and goat Singularity Cults but it's in there somewhere and it comes out so I I will be curious to hear sort of how this goes and what you guys think but this is just wild this is how the first AI millionaire was created a goat religion cheers
