# AI Experiment: Building an AI Podcast, by AI

you know one of the really exciting things about llms is how fast they make experimentation the the gap between idea and getting something done is really quick and I lived that out last night I was able to take an idea a concept and get it into something actionable within 15 minutes and I'm going to share it with you here so one of the things that I've really struggled with is keeping track of all these interesting links that I find around the web and reading them digesting them really understanding them part of it is a time issue part of it is being able to get myself into the language and the context of the person writing the piece which is very different around the web I I get academic papers I get blog posts and I have to sort of context switch from whatever I'm doing maybe it's a meeting maybe it's writing something and then get into reading mode and really understand it and then it's only one source all of that to say I don't read as many of my bookmarks as I want to and I'll bet that's true for you as well so notebook LM is a free tool that Google relas just a couple of weeks ago and it is fascinating to me because it makes it possible to take all of those sources and bring them together and generate a podcast that sounds very believable about a any collection of sources you want you can throw anything at it that you like and it will generate a podcast about it and I found it super helpful because it helps me to sort of get through a collection of sources and get the tldr and yes I can still dive in I have all of those sources ources they're actually logged right in the notebook I can converse with the sources so I can dive deeper but the podcast makes sure that I don't miss the general concept I'm looking to explore but I realized that this tool is not really sharable right now so a notebook as is currently exists is not something I can share to the web it's not something where I can take the little podcast they create and share that either it just generates a wave file and I don't want that to be the case one of the things I've really struggled with is how to convey efficiently some of the advanced concepts that I talk about for AI for llms and then I sometimes get comments here on YouTube or on my Tik Tok asking me to explain and so I could do a Tik Tok on what is Laten space but those tend don't tend to get a lot of views to be honest with you because it appeals to a very specific audience so why not make an AI generated podcast in a notebook on latent space and find a way to share it that was my idea and it took me 10 minutes and I got a Spotify podcast up and going uh I'll put the link down here under the YouTube and it's not going to be my voice I don't pretend it's my voice it's an AI generated voice that actually sounds very human just kicking it back and forth between two or three AI voices talking about a particular subject and I'm going to be selecting the subjects I'm going to be feeding its sources and sort of shaping the content and it becomes a notebook and that's why I called it Nate's notebook and it becomes a way for me to share some of these complex concepts with the folks who are listening to my content here on YouTube or on Tik Tok and it's easy to follow it's easy to understand it's asynchronous they can dig in whenever they want and so I just threw it up there we'll see what happens I don't know it might not be successful but it was 10 minutes of work and it's helpful for me anyway to be able to have a place to link folks to when they have questions like that and also to be able to shape future podcast episodes to the questions that people have because this space continues to emerge and grow so all of that to say one of my favorite favorite things right now about llms is how fast it is to experiment and I think it's great that I was able to put together a Cutting Edge tool like notebook LM with a very traditional tool like Spotify podcasts and get something out there really quickly and that's one of those sort of work flows that I will be talking about a lot more in the maven course that I have coming I actually have a lightning lesson coming uh on Thursday October 3rd so it's a two days from the recording date here and that's free it's 30 minutes we're going to dive into a different workflow that I found really fun um that I created specifically for this lightning lesson so you haven't heard about it elsewhere and I think you I think you'll like it I think it'll be very fun and exciting so if you're interested if you'd like to learn more about Advanced models if you'd like to try out sort of what it looks like to have ai sort ort of drive a workflow and shape your day-to-day work a little bit we'll have a teaser trailer of that in the 30 minute time time we have together um and I'll be diving much more deeply into all of that um for product managers for engineers and for non-technical folks folks like accoun exex uh seite leaders who are looking to advance their knowledge of AI uh so I'll get into all of that in the maven course as well so there you go head fun experimenting part of this course is designed to get you experimenting to get you thinking about llms uh and they can do for you
