# Everyone's Chasing AI Skills—But Judgement is Now Priceless

We're all becoming judgment merchants. I know that's a new word. I'm coining it. The reason I'm saying that is that whether you work as an external consultant in AI around AI or whether you're working inside a company and you are building in AI systems, wanting to build an AI systems, leaning in on Chad GPT, everyone is going to have to start practicing judgment. This is not a taught skill. This is not something that you can just go and say, "Oh, I know judgment now. I'm good at judgment." In fact, for a long time, the ability to exercise good business judgment was the bar for principal product manager, the bar for a senior engineering leader. Now, what I'm suggesting to you is that we need to find ways to cultivate that for every level, for every job family. Why is that? Because intelligence is becoming too cheap to meter. Sam Alman was saying that intelligence is falling x a year in cost. X a year for the same intelligence level. If that is even remotely close to true, we have to double down on being good judgment merchants. And if that sounds too abstract, it's not going to be by the time you're done with this video. I'm going to go through 10 principles. As far as I know, no one has really put together a miniourse on how to have good judgment in the age of AI, even though that's an irreplaceable skill and we talk about it a lot. So, let's get into it. What are 10 ways we can show we exercise good judgment? This applies regardless of job family. And this should be specific enough for you to actually jump in and wrap your head around. That's my goal. Number one, the scarcity principle. So intelligence is abundant, right? If it's coming down at a cost of 40x a year, everybody's going to have intelligence. Value then migrates to the next bottleneck. Basically, one of the ways you show value, whether you are inside a company like Walmart or Netflix or Amazon or a tiny company like a series A or a Seed or whether you're outside as a consultant, everywhere you look on an AI project, you will see places where intelligence unlocks an enormous amount of volume and you will see places where that volume bottlenecks. Part of your value is finding the bottlenecks. It's the scarcity principle. Find what is still scarce in a world where intelligence is abundant. Get eyeballs, get get binoculars, get a microscope, whatever metaphor you want, but find the scarcity. The scarcity is there. Maybe it's scarcity of selection and sort of finding what to choose. Maybe it's scarcity of sequencing. It's really hard to know how to sequence. Maybe it's scarcity of implementation. Maybe it's scarcity of human resources in other areas. There is always going to be something scarce. Maybe customer attention is scarce, right? Find the scarcity. The fastest signal of good judgment is how precisely you can define the true current bottleneck. And that is true whether you're internal or external. Principle number two, context. Judgment is contextsensitive synthesis. In other words, you are reusing patterns with an awareness of what makes this situation unique. Good judgment is excellent pattern recognition crossed with excellent context discrimination. You know the current context and you have enough of a pattern recognition that you can actually put them together. Poor judgment is overgeneralizing on a past success or failure or just relying on an AI generated best practice. The implication is that if you are hungry to show you have good judgment, you can surface the nontransferable elements of your recommendation and put those in center stage. So when you're talking internally about a project you want done, when you are externally and you're pitching something as a consultant, what is unique about this moment, this org, this system? Let's say you're a product manager and you're trying to get something built and it's an AI native architecture. What is it about this org that makes that solution specifically correct? If you are looking to show you have good judgment, look to show you understand context deeply. That is your advantage. Get passionate about a particular corner of context. Principle number three is the constraint principle. You are analyzing what's possible and you are judging what's possible. Now, analysis by itself is paralyzing. analysis will tell you all of your options. But a great business builder will think in terms of constraints, will think in terms of what is the possible build that we can execute today. And so an excellent judge, someone who shows good judgment in the middle of the AI age, understands intuitively within a given context what is possible. Now, do you see how these principles build on each other? I've sequenced them carefully. These are not randomly allocated principles. They build on each other so that you actually develop a cleaner and cleaner understanding of judgment as we go forward. Number four is the sequencing principle. Most insights fail because timing is bad or sequencing is bad. Judgment shows up in ordering your bets to create momentum and proof before resistance starts to mount. In other words, if you are internally trying to champion an AI system and there is some skepticism about how this system will work, order your bets carefully. Show good judgment by showing you know how to sequence bets and thin slice your value so that you can deliver something that people can believe in. Thin slicing value sounds abstract until you basically have to look at an MVP of a buildable system and say this little piece that's what I'm going to deliver because that earns trust. Maybe initially we're only going to deliver a chatbot on this particular page on the website. Maybe initially we're only going to convert this part of the wiki into a rag system internally. Maybe initially I'm only going to offer this particular piece of value in my consultancy as an AI consultant because I know I can deliver it and I know I can deliver it fast. That will earn trust and then I can deliver more. Sequencing matters and good judgment shows up in knowing what is possible. Now, principle five is dep prioritization. Everyone's favorite word. Know what not to do. Have non- goals. Explicitly list and defend ideas that you are not going to go after and not going to pursue. Have a rationale for that. That is something I will guarantee you that AI is not so great at. AI loves to expand scope. One of the signals of good judgment in 2025 of someone who is accountable for their work is they will be honest with you at a moment's notice about what they are saying no to what they are deprioritizing what they cannot do. That is irreplaceable. And that is something honestly that is an excellent piece of career advice in an age littered with do more, do more, do more. What are you doing that is too much? What are you doing that you need to let go of so you can focus more effectively? And if you really commit to that, if you choose what you're going to depprioritize when you look at a project, you open the door to disproportionate leverage. And so when you see projects that are runaway successes, part of why they're runaway successes is someone in that project said, "This is the goal. Not this, not this, not this. We are building a chatbot for the customer. It will not have the ability to use images. It will not have voice initially. It will not give you the ability to upload files. it will be extremely good at talking about the products on our website. That is all focus have non- goals and that's true whether you're trying to define what to build or whether you're trying to define what you're doing next. It is it is a universal truism. It's absolutely essential. You you have to say no in order to be able to say yes. And it's something that I I keep beating the drum on it because AI is so bad at it. And I want to call out like the there are things AI is terrible at and this is one of them. like specialize in this, right? Dep prioritization. Number six, the calibration principle. Judgment compounds through feedback on accuracy. In other words, your judgment gets better as you get feedback on what goes right and what does not go right. You start to anticipate more correctly as you get feedback on what works and doesn't work. In a sense, this principle is fractal. It works for your career in the sense that you try things on and you say that worked, that didn't work. But that takes period of years, right? That takes time. It also works on projects. It works on AI projects especially well because AI projects are typically run fast and they're run hard and you get feedback quickly. And so if you set up an AI agent and you see nobody is using it internally, you get feedback on how you scope that agent. Maybe you prioritize incorrectly. Maybe you depp prioritize the one thing that the business actually wanted. You can learn from that. You can calibrate. You can get better. Principle number seven. This is another key element of good judgment. It's a coalition principle. Good judgment includes mapping the social graph of decision makers and sequencing their buyin correctly. You need to be planning conviction moments where stakeholders experience early wins and shift their stance from merely permitting something to happen to active ownership. And if that sounds too abstract, if you're trying to get something over the line internally as a project, it only happens if you get your director and then your director's peer and then your senior vice president and then finally the seauite on board. That's exactly what I just described. I just used abstract terms for it so everybody could understand it. It's the same thing. If you're a consultant, you run through the same process. Do you see that? One of my larger thesis is that we are overblowing the death of consultants. It is it is actually I think more correct to say that a lot of the busy work in producing decks that consultants have done for a long time is going to go away. But the idea of someone who offers good judgment is becoming more and more important because AI is bottlenecked on good judgment. And so excellent consultants that offer good judgment are priceless. But so are excellent internal teammates who offer good judgment. In a sense, we are all becoming consultants. So the coalition principle matters. Figure out who needs to go from permission to excitement to ownership to enthusiasm and sequence your conviction moments, your aha moments to get them there. That's good judgment. Again, AI can't help you there. Principle eight is the responsibility principle. Judgment carries ownership. The clearest tell of good judgment is a willingness to say, "If I'm wrong, here's how we'll know it, and here's how what we'll do." You don't have to be right all the time to have good judgment. People sometimes think you do, but you have to have accountability and you have to be willing to say if I made a mistake, here's what we're going to do about it. This is where I often tell people the fastest way to fix AI slop at work is to tell everyone, you are accountable for every word you write. It can be with AI, but you're still accountable. That accountability is a sign of good judgment. Own the consequences. Own the consequences. Again, not something AI is good at. Number nine, the transparency principle. In the old model, assess opacity, signal value. Trust the deck. That's a fancy way of saying just trust our deliverables. A shiny report. Now, people actually trust transparent reasoning more. This is a trend that's opening up because intelligence is so available. When intelligence was was expensive, people trusted that a wellp polished deck was a sign that you'd put a lot of good thought into it. Now, a wellp polished deck is just, you know, a chat with Kimmy K2 away, but a thoughtful deck is not. A thoughtful deck still requires good old-fashioned brain power. And so, being more transparent with your reasoning is coming into vogue. You want to be honest about the options. You want to be honest about your depp prioritization logic, about your assumptions, how you think it through, what trade-offs you're negotiating. That is something that wasn't true 5 years, 10 years ago in the same way that it is today. that is somewhat new and it's a response to AI. It is a way of showing you know how to think clearly, logically in an age where AI just wants to spit tokens because the difference between intelligence that just says everything is on the table. We won't have non- goals. We're going to be super aggressive. An intelligence that can lay out hard trade-offs really clearly is real. If you've seen good thinking, you know the difference between really good quality thinking and the first draft out of chat GPT. Don't just ship the first draft out of Ched GPT. Good judgment is showing transparently how you are actually wrestling with the problem. Principle 10 is the compounding principle. Judgment creates leverage when it's encoded into systems that last. And so a lot of good judgment is figuring out how to solve a problem by scaling out a playbook or an automation that others can run with. So your judgment shifts then from personal heroics to true organizational capability. I want to give you some encouragement. The 10 principles I've outlined are all things that AI is not getting better at all that fast. So if you're sitting there wondering why is Nate talking about this soft skill stuff? Isn't AI going to be good at all this stuff? The answer is these are the soft skills that distinguish what humans are good at in the age of AI. I want you to know it because I think it's not something that is taught well because we didn't have to learn it except by osmosis before. Principal engineers learn this from other principal engineers for their discipline. Now someone has to start teaching it for all of us because suddenly judgment is all of our job. Good judgment is something that AI can't take away. So we'd better get good at it. So we'd better learn it. So we better learn how to teach it. And that's where this is coming from is I want everyone to start to get into the idea of having good judgment. And I want you to start to break down the mental wall between being inside the company and outside the company because I think a lot of the traditional roles that consultants had are now being occupied by people inside the company as well. Those lines are starting to blur. And similarly, you see consultants doing software work that in the old days would have been done by internal employees. It's another example of AI pushing the lines. And that's all happening because intelligence is becoming cheaper and cheaper and judgment is becoming more valuable. Judgment is the new bottleneck. Judgment is what is becoming scarce when analysis is free. I hope you enjoyed this. I hope you feel like you have a better sense of what actually goes into the idea of good judgment. And I hope you're able to apply it at work because that's the whole point. I wrote this up more on the blog. I have a prompt to help you think through where you need to learn and grow on judgment. Dig in and have fun.
