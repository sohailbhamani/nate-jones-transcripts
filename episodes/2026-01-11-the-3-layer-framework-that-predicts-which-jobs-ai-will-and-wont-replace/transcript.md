# The 3-Layer Framework That Predicts Which Jobs AI Will (and Won't) Replace

If you're in business and you're a leader trying to figure out where to place your AI bets, most of the analysis you read these days is kind of useless. It's either too abstract. AI will transform everything. It will automate all things or it's too tactical. Here's how to use Chad GPT for customer service. What's missing is a strategic middle layer, a clear picture of how AI actually changes competitive dynamics and what that means for where your business is vulnerable and where it's actually, ironically, protected. This is what I'm focusing on in this video. The key insight is that AI is not uniformly intensifying competition everywhere. It's actually bifurcating the economy. And I don't think we talk about this enough in digital spaces, contestable markets, markets where output is easy to compare and customers can switch easy. AI is commoditizing the baseline there and absolutely crushing middle tier businesses. Whereas in physical markets, markets that are dominated by local relationship heavy dynamics, AI is lowering overhead and it's not actually increasing competitive pressure and so prices and margins are rising in those spaces. Your strategic position as a business leader depends entirely on where you sit in the economy and where in the value chain your firm makes money. And that should shape your AI investment. So, by the end of this video, I want you to have a sense of the overall picture of AI implications for the economy and for businesses and a sense of how to diagnose where your business sits and specific guidance on AI investment based on your business's position in the economy, which should shape your durable advantage. If that sounds like a mouthful, we're going to get into it and explain how you can actually analyze your own position, get past the conventional wisdom, and come to some useful conclusions around AI investments. First, the standard story about AI in business goes something like this. Lean AI native startups are growing quickly. They're proliferating, and they will eat the giants unless the giants accelerate because big companies are slow. They're bureaucratic. They're burdened by legacy systems, legacy thinking. You've heard this story before. Startups move fast. They adopt new tools constantly. They build AI native from day one. You've also heard that story before. The disruptors will win. The incumbents will fall. We've seen this movie. The story isn't wrong about everything, but it misses the detailed shape of what's happening in ways that help leaders make investment decisions. And that's what I want to get into here. First, the giants are not nearly as vulnerable as the story might suggest. Many of them have moes that AI cannot effectively erode. And the startups may not be quite as threatening as advertised because the capabilities that they are selling are often getting cheaper by the month which is a problem if your whole value proposition is the capability and not the distribution. Ironically the place where firms are actually in trouble is in between because the conventional wisdom is looking just at the small firms and the big firms and missing the entire middle tier of the professional services and software industries. Think the marketing agency with 40 employees. The IT consultancy that's been around for 15 years. The software development shop that serves mid-market clients. The design firm that built a reputation on being reliable and improfessional over the last couple of decades. Those firms are getting squeezed from both directions. from below by tiny teams that are using AI to produce work that's nearly indistinguishable from what a mid-tier firm can get done and from above by giants with distribution advantages that the mid-tier firm cannot match. They have no obvious escape route. Now, let's jump over to a different part of the economy. We've looked at software for a second. I want to look at the hardware side of things briefly before we come back. If you were in the atoms business, by which I mean you move atoms around for a living, maybe you're touching people's mouths and you're a dentist, maybe you're an HVAC technician, maybe you work in plumbing, maybe you work in moving people's homes, whatever it is, if you're a plumber or accountant or a specialty physician, net AI is helping you. It is a huge tailwind for you because it lowers your administrative burdens. It makes you more efficient, but it is not exposing you to the brutal competition that's tearing its way through the digital services and product economies. And so to understand why these patterns are emerging simultaneously, why AI is not making local services more competitive, but is tearing into digital services, it's important to get past the AI disrupts everything story and get into the specific mechanics of where pressure intensifies and where it doesn't. And that's going to lead us to an investment strategy. So AI is collapsing the cost of a specific kind of work. Cognitive tasks that can be expressed in language. If you are drafting, if you are summarizing, if you are analyzing, if you are researching, if you are coding and planning and generating variations, this is all tokenizable cognition. It's thinking that can be captured as text. And therefore, it is something that can be handled by a language model. And the cost of that work, I'm just going to be honest, no one's surprised here, it's falling towards zero. A first draft that took a junior employee two hours now takes 10 minutes at most. And research that required a specialist can be done with really good prompts in an hour or so. The floor has risen dramatically. Work that used to be hard to produce and offer competitive advantage is now trivially easy. But here's the point where most AI commentator commentators go off the rails. When something gets cheaper, we typically use more of it, not less. This is Jieven's paradox. It's named after a 19th century economist who noticed that the more efficient a steam engine got, it didn't actually reduce coal consumption. It exploded the usage of steam engines. Efficiency made steam power economical for brand new applications. It removed a cost barrier and demand just rushed in to fill that cost barrier. The same thing is happening with cognitive work. Firms aren't producing less analysis because AI makes analysis cheap. They're producing far far more. More customer segments each with detailed messaging, more AB tests, more internal reports, more first drafts to choose from. Now you can get to your entire software backlog. The volume of cognitive output is exploding. It's not contracting. So the first order effect is not AI replaces cognitive workers. It is AI enables vastly more cognitive work and humans have to shift our tasks within that expanded volume. And then the question becomes which task do humans shift to and what becomes a constraint when the raw production of cognitive work is essentially free. I'd like you to think about what happens in a business as having three layers. The first layer is the tokenizable cognition that I just talked about. Drafting, analysis, coding, etc. This is the layer where AI has made marginal cost collapse. A firm can now produce effectively unlimited quantities of this work at near zero incremental cost. The second layer is judgment and accountability. Someone has to decide which of the drafts look good. Someone has to sign off on the analysis. Someone has to own the outcome if the recommendation turns out to be wrong. This is not getting cheaper. This layer requires human judgment and it requires humans who are authorized to be accountable. AI can generate the options. It cannot own the accountability for the decisions. The final layer gets back to the atoms part of the economy. It's physical execution. Maybe that's installation. Maybe that's repair. Maybe that's face-to-face caregiving. No matter how good AI gets at generating text, it cannot show up at your house and fix your furnace. The layer is constrained by the physical world in ways that do not yield the software improvements. And so what happens when AI floods that first layer with unparalleled abundance? Well, the second and the third become binding constraints in the software business where you're not dealing with atoms as much. It's just the second layer and you're dealing with this incredible crush of a bottleneck on judgment and taste. In physical businesses, you have both the second and the third layer in play where you have judgment and taste and also you have the need to provide the physical service at a particular time and place. But regardless of where you sit, that three layer map is useful because it gives you a sense of where your competitive disadvantage lies. If your firm mostly sells first layer work, the drafting, the analysis, the code, you got a big the work is becoming commoditized. Your competitors can can produce it for similar quality, often at a lower cost. The thing you are selling is no longer special. It's no longer scarce. If your firm's value was always in the second layer though, you're in a much better spot. It was if it was always in the relationships, if it was always in the accountability, in the good taste, you still need to produce good first layer work, but now you can produce it cheaper and you still depend for value on that second layer, good judgment and taste to compete. And of course, if you're in the third layer, you're in a really good spot because the fundamental economics favor you at this point. Now, let's get more precise about who's in trouble and how competitive positions are changing. Consider a marketing agency with 50 employees for the past 15 years. Let's say the firm's made money by being professional. It's reliable. It's competent. They're not the cheapest, but they deliver really good work. They deliver it on time, and they've established client reputations. What does this firm actually sell? Mostly, it sells first layer work. It sells plans. It sells campaigns. It sells copy analysis. It sells strategy decks. The partners did do some second layer work. Uh they did some client management. They did some accountability. But the bulk of the revenue is build to the cognitive production of the staff that produces all of these campaigns and so on. AI changes this firm's competitive position in multiple directions. Right from below, a team of three people with good AI tools can now produce as much work as that 50 person agency produces. Now, is it identical? No. But is it close enough that clients start to wonder why they're paying for 50 people? Yes, the tiny team is faster, it's cheaper, and it's increasingly competitive on quality. They might not have the agency's reputation, but they have a portfolio, and they can price aggressively. Meanwhile, look at a giant media company. They they have holding companies. They have platforms with distribution modes. They can offer endto-end turnkey service. They have embedded offerings that lock clients into ecosystems. They have advantages that the 50 person company doesn't have and can't hope to match. And so, the 50 person agency is really kind of stuck. It can't match the cost structure of the lean AI native competitors because it has employees, it has offices, it has overhead from a different era. And it also can't match the distribution and the stickiness the giants bring with their ecosystem plays because it never had those structural advantages in the first place. That dynamic is now playing out across the entire digital professional services economy. software consultancies, design firms, analytic shops, current production companies, research firms, any mid-tier player whose value proposition was we produce cognitive work is in danger. But ironically, that same technology change AI is actually good for the same size firm in the atoms moving business. Let's look at a plumbing company. The firm sells third layer work mostly, right? A human being shows up at your house. It fixes the problem. The problem goes away. Your pipes now work. AI helps this firm. It can automate scheduling. It can automate dispatch. It can automate invoicing. And AI doesn't threaten the firm in a way it threatens the marketing agency because the service is not more contestable. Contestability is really the key concept here. A market is contestable when buyers can easily evaluate alternatives and switch very effectively. But the plumbing company, no matter how good AI is, is not going to see a more contestable market. whereas the marketing agency is because it's really easy to switch marketing agencies. I can switch for a marketing agency in Hong Kong tomorrow. I cannot switch for a plumber in Hong Kong. And there's yet one more force working in favor of the plumber. Bow's cost disease. This is an economic observation from the 1960s. As some sectors of the economy get more productive, wages tend to rise economywide, which means that sectors that don't get more productive become relatively more expensive. If the classic example is orchestras, it still takes the same number of musicians to play a Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mozart Quartet as it did in 1790. But musicians today get paid enormously more because they could otherwise go and work in industries where productivity has increased. AI is making parts of the economy dramatically more productive. That is going to pull up wages everywhere and anything that can't be made productive by AI is going to become relatively more expensive. This is a counterintuitive claim. Most people are going to tell you that you're going to see wages hit the wall, that there's going to be massive unemployment, etc. But one of the thing we don't discuss is that that will only happen if and when AI is able to get into the second and third layers that I've been talking about. If AI gets into the judgment and taste layer, if AI gets into physical atoms and touching spaces. Now, I know that we've made investments in robotics. There's entire startups that are going after that space. That breakthrough is not here yet. I think we are much more likely to see breakthroughs in factories than we are to see breakthroughs in home services in the near term. But by and large, we aren't seeing the kind of generalpurpose technology unlock for robotics yet in the way that we have for language and text. And we aren't seeing the kind of general purpose unlock on judgment and taste in cognitive services that we have seen for the production and drafting of work. So drafting code is easy. It still takes a good senior engineer to architect the system to ensure it actually works correctly. If you put all this together, you get a bifurcated economy, a barbell economy. On the one end, you have digital and contestable markets where AI is commoditizing the baseline and intensifying competition. In those markets, the long tale of mediocre producers is going to die quickly. Competition consolidates around firms that either have distribution modes or firms with incredible efficiency. Think small AI native teams. The middle is going to get crushed between those two ends. On the other side, you have physical local relationship heavy markets where AI lowers the overhead through efficiencies in back office automation, but doesn't actually increase the contestability of the market. And in those markets, the longtail survives and frankly often thrives. So given all of this, here's how to think about AI investments depending on where you sit. If you're a mid-tier firm in a contestable digital market, think marketing, software services design content analytics you've got two viable paths. And yes, you do have a death trap. Path one is to get radically lean. You need to cut your headcount. You have to cut overhead. You have to rebuild around a small core team that uses AI to produce at the level your current staff produces. You're racing against threeperson startups, and you need to act like it. Path two is you got to move up the stack. You stop selling first layer cognitive production and you start leaning really heavily into second layer judgment, accountability, quality. This means changing what you charge for, right? You can't ch charge for deliverables in the same way you're charging for the quality of the output that you're actually selling. And so your AI investments need to support that shift. They need to support the tools that help your senior people to do more high judgment work well. And that's different from investing in tools that help junior people produce more drafts. Now, the death trap is investing in AI to make your current model more efficient. If your model is 50 people producing cognitive work and you make that 20% more efficient with AI, it's probably not enough to compete with the super lean players that are three people strong. You're just dying slower. Let's switch over. If you're a firm in a physical local relationship heavy market, let's say you're in the trades, you're in dentistry, your AI investments should actually focus really heavily on back office, right? overhead reduction and customer experience are not going to be as important, ironically, and instead investing in basic stuff like scheduling, dispatch optimization, automating customer communications, getting quotes out to every customer, invoicing and collections. This does improve the customer experience in the sense that it makes it more predictable, every single call gets answered, etc. But all it really does is it makes your back office operation more turnkey so that you can focus on delivering in the market in physical spaces where you actually compete. AI can't do that part. And so in that world, you should actually be aware of vendors that sell transformation when what you're really looking for is just those basic efficiency plays. Now, if you're building or investing in AI native startups, you have a different position to play. You have to understand and think all the time about the fact that pure cognitive production is a depreciating asset. If your startup's value proposition is we use AI to produce X cheaper and faster, you're in the commodity business. Every other AI native startup can make the same claim. Your margins will compress as the underlying models keep getting cheaper. This can still be a good business if you have distribution, if you're embedded in workflows, if you have a platform, if switching costs are high, but cognitive production is not a moat. And so the startups that will sustain value here are those that own bottlenecks in the second layer. Run toward compliance. Run toward audit infrastructure. Run toward really solid human in the loop review systems as a part of what you offer. Run toward liability and accountability wrappers around agents. Run toward workflow orchestration that embeds you in how your clients operate. These are harder to build than AI that makes X, but they're much more defensible in ways that pure production of tokens is not going to be defensible long term. Last but not least, let's say you're a giant with a real distribution moat for you. AI is a huge upside opportunity. The moat protects you, right? Let's just be honest. Embedded client relationships, bundled offerings, platform status, brand recognition, none of these are automatically eroded by AI. If anything, they become more valuable because they become tokens of authenticity as the production layer commoditizes. And distribution is going to become a more and more scarce resource. And guess what? You're sitting on it. You got distribution. But your risk is internal and talentled. The threat is not that startups will eat you. It's that they will hire away your best people because startups can move faster and offer more upside to the individual employee. The threat is really that you will not be able to change how you operate fast enough and startups will start to eat away the edges of the empire that you've created in ways that ultimately it's the death by a thousand cuts risk that you have to face and it starts as an internal talent threat. And so your AI investment should be coupled with genuine operational change because you are investing in your teams. You're convincing your teams that they are in the right place, that you care about them, they have an AI native future here in this larger business, and that you're going to give them the tools that they need to build amazing things inside this larger enterprise. There is an internal innovation challenge for large companies that I think we often overlook and firms that lose long-term. When you think about the slow death of Kmart in the US and other big department stores, those are firms that ultimately lost the ability to deliver extraordinary service to their customers and they were just out competed by firms that were able to do the same thing efficiently over time. And that, by the way, is an example of a firm that got out competed even though it had advantages in that third layer physical space. You had to go to a store to buy furniture in the old days, right? I know it's hard to believe for the young people, but it's true. And Walmart out competed them because Walmart was able to deliver on the core promise of putting inventory where the customer could get it at more affordable prices in a wider array of places and ultimately built out the brand. And so I know I've emphasized the advantages big firms have and we and you do, right? You have strong advantages across the board, especially around distribution, but that doesn't make you immune to the competitive environment threat that AI is generating. Think of AI as increasing the speed of all of the ankle biters in your space, all of the small firms that are nibbling at the business. And your job is to invest on your internal talent side enough that you can encourage innovation within your larger departments at a pace that allows you to match the threats of those ankle biters and defend the space that your business currently occupies reliably and even continue to grow. The bottom line here is that AI, this is for everybody. AI is not uniformly intensifying competition. It's actually reshaping which markets are contestable and which are not, which parts of the value chain are scarce and which are abundant. And so your strategic position, where you choose to invest, it really depends on having a very cleareyed assessment of where you sit in this reshaped 2026 economic landscape. If you're in the middle tier of a contestable digital market, you're an endangered species. You have to choose a direction. You got to get get differentiated or you got to get lean. Staying in the middle is not a strategy that works. If you're in a physical local relationship heavy market, you're more protected. AI becomes an opportunity to get more efficient, but you shouldn't mistake efficiency tools for the kind of strategic transformation that lots of people are trying to sell you because there's no point in becoming AI transformed entirely if AI is not going to actually change what you deliver and you're a plumber. Like, you got to just do the plumbing. If you're building or funding AI native startups, you've got to run as fast as possible toward distribution advantage and toward those second level bottlenecks where humans need to exercise good judgment because if you're just producing something that depends on tokens, you're you're in a losing position long term. And finally, if you're a giant, the opportunity is real, but the risk of squandering it is real, too. AI doesn't directly threaten your moat, but it strengthens your ankle biter competitors and it requires you to change how you work so that you can retain talent and keep your competitive advantage long term. So this bifurcated economy is going to shape where all of us work in 2026. You already are standing in this economy. The question is, how are you shaping your AI investments to make sense of where your unique position is? I'd love to hear what you think in the comments. Cheers.
