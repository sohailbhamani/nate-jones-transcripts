# I Tracked Every AI Win & Failure in 2025. Here's What Actually Worked (9 Surprises)

You know, 2025 didn't deliver the science fiction version of AI that gets lots of clicks, but it exceeded my expectation in ways that matter more. It clarified where value is actually coming from in the AI revolution, and it made the gaps that we still have visible in a way that I think is useful. The number one thing that I want to call out as we sort of look back at the year 2025 is I think that we all or almost all of us underestimated how powerful it is when you allow an LLM to use code as a tool. That turns out to be an absolutely massive unlock. It's at the heart of a lot of our agentic workflows these days and it is on the verge in 2026 of being one of the biggest places where non-code non-technical folks can lean in and start to figure out how agents can work for them in ways that are far removed from writing code. And I think that that that core unlock of wow an LLM can work with code therefore it can work with any part of the computer. That was one of those pieces that you could see that vision as something that the model makers had in their heads at the beginning of 2025 and they did talk about it but it wasn't realized. It was very much a someday we will see this come true and then over the course of the year you know we get cloud code we start to get model context protocol starts to dominate we start to get skills we start to get codeex and you start to gradually see these pieces come together you see the development of cursor etc. And what you start to see is that these pieces allow everyone, not just technical users, to start to use the tool because now plain English allows you to talk with your computer. Now plain English allows you to manipulate the files on your computer any way you want. Absolutely massive unlock. And I think it is hard to correctly estimate going in how big that turned out to be. The second one I think that turned out to be absolutely massive is images. And people have talked about this, but we have lived in a world for most of 2025 where images were getting better, but text remained the most accurate way to work with LLMs. And in that world, code is just a subset of text, right? Accurate code is just another language that the LLM has to learn. But images are how humans process information quickly. And when we finally got to the point where we had images solved, where you could do detailed infographics, you could do detailed text and image and it wouldn't look weird. You could do full maps, you could do layouts, you could do slides. I don't think we realized how big of an unlock getting that right was. And that doesn't just mean we got powerpoints, right? Like we did solve powerpoints, but think of it more broadly than that. Think of it as generative UI for gaming. Think of it as you have a chance to redecorate the rooms in your house now in ways that you never did before. Uh there's all kinds of personal applications that people are building on with fashion that come with this. Basically, getting images right enables us to realize a vision of graphical user interfaces that has always been out of reach. the idea that the graphical user interface isn't locked to your screen and locked to what the developer says. That the graphical user interface becomes something that evolves with you. Maybe you end up with it as a wearable. Maybe you end up with it as a combination of phone and laptop. Maybe you end up with it being generative in the side like it is for Comet. Those are all variants of this idea that with the right graphics solve from an AI perspective, that whole surface becomes continuous. and you can evolve the surface of engagement digitally with where an individual is at and what they're looking for in that moment. Now, we're not all the way there yet. I'm not here to tell you that the future of the web is everybody has a generative interface that changes for everything that they need. There is a value in habit. There's a value in steadiness for common use cases. We don't need to reinvent the wheel where it's incredibly obvious. But I do think solving images is one of those things that we probably underestimated how big a deal that was going in and like looking at it on the other side a month or two in it's absolutely massive. Like it's it's huge. What are some other ones? I think those ones are pretty common reflections. Let's go a little bit deeper. I think one of the things that surprised me is how far you can get without AI developers. So we we were told at the beginning of the year AI developers are everything. Like you need to have a developer that knows AI. I actually think you need someone who can design systems. I have watched individuals outexecute entire development teams because they treated engineering as a workflow they could design and they didn't worship at the altar of a particular model. And so they were okay building low tech things like templates, like validators, like retries. And they iterated really quickly and aggressively. And they didn't confuse Agentic with good. And before you know it, those folks are understanding the new principles for evolving agentic systems. And then they become more and more valuable. And and I think we are going to have to throw away the idea that there are technical and non-technical people. I think a more accurate description is that everyone picks up the degree of technical skills they need to solve the problems they're interested in. And increasingly the question is going to be, are you curious about the problems that are relevant in your domain? And are you willing to dive in and pick up the AI skills you need to solve those problems, including technical skills, because those are increasingly approachable. You can get a scheduled task with a nice learning composed just for you in chat GPT every morning if you want. And I do I get them. It's really nice. I get nice little coding reviews every morning. You can get it for whatever you want. Another one that I think positively surprised me about 2025, verification loops in Agentic systems turn out to be incredibly powerful. Uh the idea that you can measure correctness in different dimensions turns out to have incredibly wide ranging implications for good system design. And that's not super surprising if you know how software is designed. But hooking that up to an agent that iterates is it's like hooking up a jet engine to an airplane. Like it's it's amazing how fast you can go when you stick an agent against a verification loop that is hard to game and you say go get it done. And I think that we figured that out as a community partway through the year and started really really practicing it and that has supercharged our progress. And the nice thing is that's one of those primitives that we can really build on heading into 2026. Like getting more into verification loops is something that I think we'll see from more and more teams. And I think we're going to start to see some consistency around those. So there's things like accessibility where you just want to have a standard set of eval verification loops across the industry and people just need to get their agents to pass them when they're building software and it should not be something you have to reinvent every time. So I think we're going to start to see a really interesting ecosystem build up around verifications. That's that's compelling. Another one that has been really good to see is the messy middle turned out to be the entire game. Everyone wants to talk about the idea of the front end and there was a lot of talk during the middle of the year about super model makers or hyperscalers owning the entire stack like Chad GPT owning the stack. Cloud code launches does cloud code own the entire stack. Is there a competitive advantage to being in the middle? Is is cursor game over etc. It turns out that there is so much value in transforming messy inputs into structured representations, in routing intent, in orchestrating calls, in handling exceptions, in providing useful user interfaces for specific things. That the middle layer is still feeling underbuilt relative to how much value we can unlock. I think most of us got that one wrong. And I think that was one of the pleasant upsides of the year is that the messy middle, yes, maybe it's vulnerable. Maybe you worry about sort of the launch of a particular hyperscaler's product idea, but there is so much value in taking raw AI model outputs and getting them into a particular domain that we are I feel like we're really underbuilt. I feel like uh probably the most prominent example of that is cursor which everyone refers to all the time but there's a whole host of other startups in the in the space not just in coding and non- tech spaces too that are are building aggressively now into the middle because we've we've realized we don't have to be afraid of it. We've realized that the model makers are essentially forming a very competitive substrate of intelligence that we can build over the top of to deliver outputs to users that are much more valuable than they're really going to be able to get from models alone. That's a really interesting one. Another one that surprised me or at least it's a positive reflection from the year. I think we are realizing now how much value there is in effectively scoping our workflows. I think agents were oversold. That was that was something that a lot of people were disappointed by because they were sold as magic buttons. But the flip side is when you put an agent in a good workflow, that's a really pleasant surprise because instead of promising that it can do everything, it turns out that when you can use it as a tool, it can do a tremendous amount reliably and you can start to really move volume over to it. And so I think the pleasant surprise is how much you can accomplish when you properly harness your agents and how big companies are leaning in and able to actually get volume done on that basis. You know, another positive for the year, I know that we had a lot of conversation around AI slop this year, but I think one of the things that I learned is that AI slop is a symptom of unconstrained and unmanaged artificial intelligence. And that companies that start to get into marketing, start to get into producing content at scale for AI, if you build the right systems, you can produce really compelling, very performant ad flows, very performant email marketing, very performant content marketing that outperforms what humans can do. And so I guess the the hopeful thing there is really we don't have to surrender to and live in a world with non-performance slop. we can actually construct these systems so that they're beautiful, so they sound good, so that people want to click on them. And I'm fully aware that right now that if you announce that your ad is AI, there's generally a backlash. I think we're just going to get to the point where we don't announce it anymore and we just do the ad that feels right, however we do it, whether that's manually, whether that's manually plus AI, whether that's AI, and we just get it done and we move on. And I think that's going to be the case with a lot of content. And the key and the measure that we should hold is, is the content useful? Is the content genuinely helpful? Is the content information dense? Is it something that I can come back to again and again and say, there's something here that I can dig my teeth into. And what we're discovering is that AI can actually be really helpful on that because it can ground you with research. It can increasingly do factchecking. It can help you think through the structure of a piece. It can help you with uh generating those ads now that we've sort of solved the images piece. And I think that gives me hope because I don't want to live in a world with slap and I don't think most people do. And I think that's going to end up being a phase and we're going to end up getting through it because there's a lot of selection pressure for better content. You know, another one that surprised me positively in 2025 is how quickly the market selected for people with very strong creative problem solving instincts. I I think we saw a quicker response from the labor market than I anticipated. Not on the dramatic headline stuff of firing and all of that. There's actually still not a ton of evidence that AI is driving overall job market declines as much as there's newspaper headlines about it everywhere. But there is a lot of anecdotal evidence around the degree to which AI is a creative or liberal arts endeavor. And I think that signal has swung really sharply. And I think that's been really positive to see technical people that wanted to express their creative side and creative people that never felt like they could be technical finally have a chance to get the AI they're looking for and get a chance to build and get a chance to share their talents and get a chance to stretch their wings in ways that they couldn't before. And so I I actually think that one of the great opportunities of 2026 is people who want to grow the edges of their domain expertise and get smarter and do more. The world is your oyster. We've never been able to lean in more that way and I think that's been really fun. And the last one I I want to call out is that we did start to see a shift from a lot of the cost cutting mentality to quality lift. It's not universal. There are absolutely still people who will see AI primarily as cost cutting. But more and more and more as I sit and talk with leaders, they're sort of recognizing after the first wave of vendor purchases and getting AI installed quickly and thinking of AI as a magic button, they still need their people. their people can't go anywhere because they still need their people to deliver the kind of value that only people can deliver in a customer-f facing organization. And so what they want is they want to have a conversation about quality. How can we level up the quality of the experience we provide to customers in ways that were unimaginable because of AI? How can we lever up the volume of customers served? How can we make the price more competitive because we're able to scale the unit economics of the business? Those are so much more interesting questions and so much more compelling questions than just saying, can we cut costs and dump AI? There will still be folks that have that sort of brutalist mindset. But I think increasingly people are starting to recognize how powerful these systems are. And they're starting to recognize that the firms that win are firms that regard their people and their people's attention as a precious asset. And they're designing AI systems around them in ways that allow people to put their expertise to work where it matters most. And so my question for you is what did I not mention? What exceeded your expectations in 2025?
