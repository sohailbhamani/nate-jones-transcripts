# AI: The story of the chips that make our world

so hurricane Helen has devastated North Carolina parts of Georgia and has made landfall in Florida why is that on a tech Focus Channel well one you should care as a human and two it's going to affect the Tech Supply Chain Spruce Pine is the only place in the world where there is scaled pure quality quartz sand that is usable for what is known as the schi process which is what we use to make special crystals that you can turn into Wafers that you can turn into chips now if that all sounds like a lot and you're like oh gosh there's sand everywhere why on Earth is this hard I'm going to explain that we are going to go on a little tour through the entire chip making process and at the end of it you're going to understand better why it's so amazing that we have chips at all all right so first off you think to yourself what is a chip made of it's made of silicon silicon is everywhere because sand is everywhere it can't be that hard pick up some sand and make a chip that's not how it works I want you to start by understanding the Purity grade that's required to make the chips that are running your computer we are now at a point where we expect 11 nines of Purity so to give you a sense of what that is that is roughly one atom being incorrect In billions and billions of atoms 10 billion atoms or more that's how pure that silicon has to be it's one of the purest substances we've ever made as a species how do you get that you don't get that by like picking the sand up and like walking into a mill with it and no it doesn't work that way I'm going to walk you through it you're going to be amazed we ever get chips at all so first off you have to have good quality silica deposits China has some China makes it you think to yourself okay that's it so it comes from China like everything else it does not there's other crucial components without which you could not make chips that do not come from China so China makes the silica China turns the silica into what's called poly silica poly silica is very very pure silica but it's not crystalline structured silica so there's a difference electrically between silica that is all jumbled at the chemical level and silica that is orderly as you would imagine if you're building circuits you want orderly silica but it doesn't just magically appear that way so this poly silica is already at 8 n of purity it's extremely pure and it's still disordered so it's not good enough for chips yet but it's good enough for a lot of other things so China makes that that's just one input Spruce Pine North Carolina which is currently underwater makes another crucial ingredient it's also sand but it's for quartz and the quartz matters because you need High Purity quartz for What's called the shoski process and I did work on pronouncing that so I hope I got it right uh the Shi process is a special process that we've invented to take very pure poly silica which is 89 Purity and turn it into polycrystalline silica which is actually an ordered chemical structure that's suitable for wafers and Wafers are what we use to make the chips and so poly crystalline silica actually grows like a crystal they stick a seed Crystal about the size of a pencil Into The Crucible which is made of the quartz from Spruce Pine and they actually rotate it the opposite direction that The Crucible is rotating and it sort of draws out a crystalline structured extremely pure silicon Ingot and the reason why these sort of have to be the same material because you're like sand and sand is because if you don't have very very pure uh Crucible around the silica you are going to get impurities from The Crucible into the silica now for like almost every application no one cares if a few atoms get in but if you are making chips that are down almost to the atomic level already you do care about the impurities of one or two atoms and so you have to have extremely pure crucibles and that's why Spruce Pine North Carolina matters and that's why I personally am somewhat concerned that it is underwater the human cost is absolutely awful I have friends I have family in in Appalachia no one expected this right no one expected a hurricane to make landfall in Florida and then dump like the worst rain that Western North Carolina has ever seen like hundreds of miles Inland it anyway I will say I looked at the Weather Service forecast they saw this about 30 hours out but that was that was about as good as they could do we're going to move back to the Silicon supply chain so now you have polycrystalline silica you've made it with your special process the shulski process use that to impress your friends who do you send it to well you send it to tsmc tsmc is a company in Taiwan that makes Cutting Edge chips almost all of The Cutting Edge 5 nanometer and 3 nanometer chips come from there and by the way if you're like oh wow it's actually three nanometers well it's more of a marketing term than anything it's basically the most advanced two generations of Chip design because there's not individual features on the chip necessarily that are exactly that dimension of five or 3 nanometers it's just used by people who want to talk about what generation were on and so in this case tsmc makes those Advanced chips they make the advanced chips for gpus that are used to power inference for large language models among other things so you think to your yourself okay they they get the they have these these ingots and then they can sort of work with them no that it's the ingots are cut with diamond saws and Polished and then they have to have a special coating put on that enables them to be etched because they're etched with light to make the circuits and you might think oh so tsmc has the light machine well they do but they don't make the light machine a Dutch company named asml makes the light machine they are the only ones as far as I can tell that make the light Ma Mach that do Advanced ship production there's a lot of they are the only ones in this story and I think part of that is because it is one very very difficult to do this it is a state-of-the-art it is a craft it is not something you can pick up a textbook and know how to do materials is really difficult to work with like materials are not software materials take experience there uh is this is like a very slight aside but there's actually someone in um Germany who is renowned for having fingers so sensitive that he can out uh sense the scientific instruments that are used to determine smoothness and so he has like a particular job at an industrial application where he's like basically like sensing smoothness with his fingertips and I think of that because craft is something that still relies on human expertise and that is part of why these bottlenecks exist in supply chain Spruce Pine knows how to take a deposit that they are sitting on and turn it into high quality quartz that's a bottleneck we are currently seeing that right now tsmc knows how to produce chips not design them produce them they are a bottleneck asml knows how to make photo lithography machines that tsmc can use to etch those chips they are a bottleneck because of the craft because it's really difficult to know how to make these things okay moving on now we have the chips where did you get the design well the design comes from the companies you know and love so Nvidia is the one that sends the design to T TMC for new gpus and then tsmc makes them so Nvidia for example launched the Blackwell architecture which it appears uses the 3 nanometer uh level of Chip fabrication although that's a little bit obscure right now uh but I think we think it's 3 nanometer and is called the b00 it's going to be used in the next generation of inference for LLS s and they're trying to make them buy basically as many as people can buy there was a there was news that broke of a dinner that uh Elon Musk and Larry Ellison of Oracle had at noou with Jensen hang the CEO of Nvidia where they basically sat down at this fancy dinner at noou and begged him for computer chips and that's really the level that we're at billionaires begging each other for chips uh and Jensen has the chips he has the gpus necessary for llms and everyone wants them then you wonder how do they get to us well as an example Oracle is going to be buying piles of these ships because they are building a billion data center hundred billion dollar Data Center and that is going to be powered by three nuclear reactors it's going to be like sucking a gig gigawatt of power we're getting to a world of like much much bigger data centers because llms are requiring them and that means more chips and that means more tsmc and more tsmc means more demand for the materials that make these chips and so this entire conversation is about understanding that our world effectively depends on very specific expertise located in a few companies distributed around the world in North Carolina in Amsterdam or well in the Netherlands in Taiwan and the people who are smart enough to design the chips themselves which who are located often in the us uh and who like actually architect the chips Korea also does good chip architecture so the reason I call this out is because right now with the Spruce Pine situation we are seeing the consequences of the tip of the spear innovation in the fragility of our supply chains if you want to get to a point where you're at 3 nanometers if you want to get to a point where you're that advanced you're going to be fra there's only a few companies that know how to do it and that's one of the things we're all sort of living with today we will see when Spruce Pine comes back online I am hoping that the town of Spruce Pine comes back online and the people who are there the hospital that's there comes back online first because that's more important um but in the meantime if you can find folks to donate to if you can find folks to support people in Western North Carolina need your support and help um and if this story helps you to recognize like how we're all interconnected that's great because it's true all right cheers
