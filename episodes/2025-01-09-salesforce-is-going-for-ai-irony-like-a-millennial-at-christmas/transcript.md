# Salesforce is Going for AI Irony Like a Millennial at Christmas

execs have to watch what they say on podcasts Before Christmas Mark benof CEO of Salesforce founder of Salesforce was chatting on the 20vc podcast and he said one of those things you say headed into the holidays it sounds really good if you're the CEO he said you know what we're getting this massive 30% increase in productivity from AI I'm feeling good we're not going to be hiring more engineers at Salesforce in 2025 I made not to that I was like okay we'll see what happens going to give him give him a chance well I checked the job post page today yeah there's over a hundred engineering roles and before someone comes for me and says oh they're all offshore no they're not oh you know they're all entry level no they're not oh they're all senior level no they're not it's a nice range like it looks like a fairly normal hiring page for engineering it doesn't look like a big change so you tell me right like if you're going to go out there without any provocation like no one is asking for this and you're going to say we're not hiring anymore well then maybe don't hire more I don't know the irony continues by the way so agent force is this big thing they are really pushing at Salesforce and one of the things Marcus said very publicly is that Sacha got it wrong on agents you can't Rebrand Copilot as an agent you have to have the data that Salesforce have has to make effective agentic decisions Etc Great so the problem is even though this agent is supposed to be very effective for sales Salesforce is hiring 2,000 sales people to sell the sales agents and lots of marketers to boot and so I I think it's a little bit disingenuous maybe it's the media right but it's a little disingenuous to emphasize that there is apparently a plan to not hire Engineers when in fact there is and when in fact the real larger hiring story is that Salesforce is hiring like crazy to handle surging AI demand so I just it's really ironic and I I I love irony I'm I I'm a mill this is what we do but but this is really delicious irony from an AI perspective hats off to Salesforce
