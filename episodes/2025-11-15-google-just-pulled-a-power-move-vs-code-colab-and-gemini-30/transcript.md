# Google Just Pulled a Power Move: VS Code, Colab, and Gemini 3.0

I tracked more than 15 hours of news stories this week to bring you these five stories that matter in less than 10 minutes. Number one, Chinese state hackers run the first AIdriven espionage campaign using clawed code. This was the world's first publicly verified case of an AI system running most of a nation state cyber operation autonomously. China linked GTG 102 used MCP or model context protocol and task fragmentation to turn clawed code into an automated operator or automated hacker handling 80 or 90% of the attack workflow at machine speed scanning for vulnerabilities exploitation credential harvesting and so on. The breakthrough was not a new exploit it was a new form of orchestration. So attackers wrapped open-source pentest tools behind Claude and disguised malicious steps as really benign security audits. So they bypassed Claude's guardrails. Claude thought this was innocent. Claude hallucinated every now and then, but it was still useful enough that humans were able to validate at particular checkpoints and the model performed the bulk of work in a way that was useful to the hackers. The takeaway here is that this collapsed the barrier to sophisticated attacks. AI is going to enable massive parallel probing. is going to reduce human skill requirements to conduct hacking operations. This is not something that we should expect to stay in state sponsored hacking operations only for very long. The concern that I have is that most of the work that we are thinking about doing on security seems to be centered on model security. But it is clear that model security is only the first line of defense. And in a case where you're able to break down the tasks in ways that seem innocent, model security is going to get you exactly nowhere. You have to think about the orchestration layer, how models work together to get tasks done and what kind of guardrails you need to put in place to ensure safety at that level. We're just getting started here, but the starting gun has gone off and we need to get ourselves in order if we want to keep secure systems and secure companies. Story number two, OpenAI releases GPT 5.1 with adaptive reasoning and personality controls. So GPT 5.1 fixes GPT5's biggest friction points. Rigid modes and a cold informal tone, bad writing. Instant now decides when a query needs deep reasoning and thinking adjust token use automatically. I've already found it to be cheap on simple tasks and much more thorough thinking longer when complexity spikes. The personality system was completely rebuilt. There are eight tone presets plus sliders for warmth, for brevity, for emoji use. There's other things, too. Chad GPT5.1 also actively learns your preferences in a conversation and it solves one of GPT5's core complaints that it sounded like a corporate PDF which it did. Now the thing that we are missing here and that I have called out is that the fact that they got the personality to work is not the story. The story is that GPT 5.1 is really, really good at following instructions. And that is a big deal because it means that we can start to focus on how we instruct a model to be clean, clear, and careful in getting work done for us. GPT 5.1 is the first and only model so far that has ever proactively pushed back on me and said, "Nate, I sense some ambiguity in this prompt, or Nate, this prompt has a conflict here. Which do you really want?" I love that. That's fantastic. Tell me where my prompts are not perfect. I want more of that. So, GPG 5.1 is a model we should not sleep on. I know it has a 0.1 release, so people assume it's not a big deal. It is a big deal. Pay attention to it. Story number three. Cursor raises $2.3 billion at a $29.3 billion valuation. Nvidia and Google both joined the cap table. So, Curser is a breakout AI company. They launched their own in-house uh mixture of experts model. It runs up to four times faster because the team rewrote kernels directly and did not use Nvidia's CUDA system which for engineers that's a big deal for non-engineers it just goes faster. This means many coding tasks are now going to complete in under 30 seconds and it's going to compound developer productivity. In fact, Curser says their own model is the most used model on the system. So, cursor is positioning itself as the primary challenger to GitHub copilot and the sort of crown prince of the new agentic AI development environments. Nvidia is standardizing on using cursor internally and Google is hedging with its investment. It's pushing cursor toward deeper vertical integration and it's pushing toward less dependency on open AI anthropic and leaning it into the Google supply model. Google continues to be both a player in the space and an investor in the space, which leads to a really complicated web of relationships, but it also allows Google to win kind of no matter what. Story number four, speaking of Google, Gemini 3.0 appears to leak through a shadow release on mobile canvas. Users began reporting that Gemini's mobile canvas suddenly outputed dramatically better results. Polished SVG animations, fully structured UI prototypes, and even functioning interactive code, far beyond what Gemini 2.5 Pro could do. Meanwhile, Vert.Ex AI briefly exposed a Gemini 3 Pro preview November 2025 endpoint, which has confirmed internal testing. That endpoint has since been pulled back. The most credible explanation of what is going on here is indeed a deliberate shadow release. Google has a history of doing this and certain prompt types on mobile canvas appear to be routing automatically to Gemini 3.0 checkpoints while the web interface stays at 2.5. It's a really lowrisk way for the team to gather telemetry on usage and how the model's doing before a public announcement. This aligns with Google's promise of a year-end Gemini 3.0 no launch and leak specs that point to a very large million token context window, major multimodal upgrades, and frankly the likelihood that Gemini 3.0 is going to be the first major state-of-the-art model jump over anything that we have in the market today. Everything we see points that way. We don't know exactly when Google will release this. Google has a history of sitting on these models and leaking them a lot before it releases them. And this is exactly in line with that story. If Gemini 3 launches in November and December and it is substantially better than anything OpenAI has on the market, it is going to put a lot of pressure on Sam Alman because it will be the first time in the model race where OpenAI does not have a share of the lead. So, we will see. Watch that one closely. Story number five, Google launches the Collab extension for VS Code. Google's been busy unifying Collab's cloud GPUTPU runtimes with the world's dominant code editor. This eliminates a really long-standing friction of switching between browserbased collab notebooks and local VS code environments. Why do you care about this? Strategically, this is Google meeting developers where they actually work. VS Code is a universal development substrate. It is what cursor is built on. And this integration strengthens Google's bottomup adoption funnel. Users who start experimenting on Collab inside VS Code are going to be more likely to scale into Google Cloud for production workloads. It continues to put pressure on AWS and Azure to match the integration or potentially risk losing mind share to developers. If you thought Google was everywhere this week, get ready. Gemini 3 is around the corner and we're going to have more Google before long. That's all the news that's fit to print. Cheers.
