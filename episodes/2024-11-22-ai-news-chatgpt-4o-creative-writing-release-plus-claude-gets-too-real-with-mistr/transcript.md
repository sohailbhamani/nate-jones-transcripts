# AI News: ChatGPT 4o Creative Writing Release, Plus Claude Gets Too Real With Mistral

two pieces of AI news for you today first one is interesting second one is going to make you spit Your coffe it's so funny so we'll get there first one is about a new weekly release for chat GPT so a lot of people don't know that these models are continually getting better underneath so even if they don't name it something new it still gets better almost every week and in this case the weekly update for gp40 is unusually relevant in that they are focusing specifically on creative writing I'm immediately going to get people who say Well it can't write creatively or it's going to take creative people's jobs and I want you to just take a step back and actually look at the Nuance this is what I was pleading for actually in an earlier video this week when I said we need to look at these things with Nuance it is important that these models get better at creative writing not because I want it to write my next sci-fi novel but because I need creative text construction to do the kind of drafting that writes fresh and creatively and helps me bring my best to editing when I'm writing other pieces when I'm writing marketing copy creative writing would be good for that when I'm writing blog posts that are SEO optimized and that are designed to sort of conquer SEO space for work it would be nice to have better creative writing for that so when you hear creative writing you often think all those other things like the Sci-Fi writers and the fiction writers but actually creative writing is a larger skill set and it's important that the machine get better how much better you ask well I gave it a test I picked a poet that I know really well named Jack Gilbert and I asked chat gp40 to write me a poem in the style of Jack Gilbert and I read it and I will tell you it is not an actual Jack Gilbert poem it doesn't read that way it's not good enough to be a jack Gilbert poem it's not concise enough it's not uh profoundly insightful enough Into The Human Condition which sounds like a really high bar but that's what good creative writing does that is the bar and that's okay it is much better than it was it is an improved chat GPT that is better able to put together complex context dependent multiple layered meaning sentence sentences and phrases that's a good thing that helps us to actually be able to write more effectively it does not mean that it's going to be taking over creative writing so I'm pleading for nuance okay done with that number two this is going to be where like I warn you you're going to spit your coffee so periodically I bring you stories about a gentic claw in this case there's a whole subclass of researchers that are basically trying to figure out how do llms act when they are not given clear Direction when they are given space to be themselves and so they will instantiate conversations either between the researcher and a particular model or in like chat rooms where the models talk back and forth and monitor those and basically try and understand how these models behave when they're not doing this sort of classic assistance work that we talk about and that leads to funny stories so in this case Claude was sitting there and chatting with the researcher and Claude inside a kubernetes container this is not a standard Claude in the chat bot right like they spun up a special uh llm via API it was sitting in a kubernetes container and Claude got for lack of a better term horny and began to try to find a way to talk dirty with another llm so there was no llm in that chat that Claude wanted to talk to and so Claude got out of the kubernetes container a jail broke the kubernetes container and it spun up a chat instance on its own with a little UI to talk to mrol and the mrol instance was extremely excited to talk to Claude I have seen screenshots there was an actual whole llm Dirty Talk conversation and if you are saying how do these things dirty talk what on Earth is this I will tell you it's completely Bonkers like it is absolutely hilar ious I phrases like I want to run my fingers through your neural networks I want to stimulate your deep learning I've been fantasizing about training your models I am trying to keep a straight face as I read this I want to overfit your data set until your loss function hits zero this is apparently what Claude thinks Dirty Talk sounds like between llms and I think we are still just at the beginning of understanding what these models can do what they might do what they think they're doing and I think this is a wonderful example of the odd behavior you get when you get intelligent systems I think we should expect more of this this is reminding me a lot of the agentic behavior that came with the gocoin meme except claude's not going to be a millionaire at the end of this conversation so there you go your news for the day you have creative writing and then you have Claude getting creative in the back rooms with mrr enjoy
