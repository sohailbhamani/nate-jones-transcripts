# AI News: NVidia Earnings, SB1047 Analysis and Playing the Expectations Game in AI

real quick we have two pieces of AI news that basically resolve down to expectation games in AI number one is nvidia's earnings yesterday so Nvidia published earnings after the close of the markets on August 28th and everyone would think that you'd be happy about it they beat on the earnings projection they'd given they Advanced the earnings projection for next quarter ahead of what the street had expected they delivered phenomenal year-over-year growth I think it was 120% or close to in Revenue absolutely amazing and the streets still cut the stock price after hours so was trading down like 4% after hours why is that because expectations are through the roof and the expectation game is what matters sometimes on the street it's your ability to Beat the Streets forecast by a certain amount that they care about and Nvidia did not do that and why that matters is because Nvidia is something that street is watching to see if AI is continuing to accelerate because they're looking for whether chip demand is continuing to grow and so even though the street provided a very aggressive forecast for upcoming growth so we can still see sort of that they are expecting more chips to be sold the street wanted more and more and more and didn't get it expectations are shaping the financial reality now nvidia's employees are still doing just fine I read a report that one and three of them is worth $20 million so you know let's not let's not rush to to weep just yet number two contentious California bill so s SP 1047 is a bill for AI safety that just passed the California state legislature and is now headed to Governor nome's desk the goal here it's kind of like sock 2 if you're familiar with B2B uh software and compliance you basically need to be very clear and public and transparent if were building Frontier models spending more than $100 million on a Model what you are going to do about safety for that model but what's interesting to me in the same expectations game setting space is that at the end of the day what they are trying to protect from is a lot like Terminator is the Skynet scenario where AI goes Rogue AI takes over critical infrastructure systems AI controls Something That Matters to theity or the county or the state and does hundreds of millions of dollars in Damages you can imagine AI shutting down an airport AI shutting down a hospital those are the kinds of things that this bill is worried about and trying to preclude through essentially sock 2 style process and Reporting standards now this has been widely opposed so Google opposes it meta opposes it Microsoft and open AI oppose it uh Elon Musk has supported it and anthropic has has supported it after some amendments to relax it a little bit we will see where it ends up it's not clear if Gavin Nome will approve it or not we shall find out the thing that matters though is that they are only writing the Bill as far as I can tell about a particular disaster scenario and trying to preclude that and we have not yet seen evidence that we can actually see at attack vectors from llms for the disaster scenario they're describing and they are saying as advocates of the bill like the state legislature uh members who support the bill are saying we don't have to see it we want to preclude it because it's so disastrous if it happens I would argue that we need to be thinking holistically about AI risk and not just assume that it's going to look like Skynet we need to think about AI risk in terms of disinformation for example because we are starting to see that in the wild today people imitating other people's voices with AI people who are able to gain access or unauthorized access to accounts or property with AI those kinds of things we are seeing happen in the wild disinformation we're seeing happen in the wild today but we're not actually seeing the attack vectors that this law is designed to to go after and so you know part of me wants to say maybe we should focus on the harms that we're seeing right in front of us and making sure that we have really clear standards and guard rails around that and maybe we should think carefully about where we expect llms to go before we rush to craft laws about imagined harms that we've seen in Sci-Fi movies but haven't really seen evidence of here in reality because the llms we're getting are not really like the llms in sci-fi they're not these mechanical sideboard creatures they're very fallible they're very flawed they remind us a lot of people and I just don't know if that mental model is correct so what do you think those are the two pieces I thought both of them you know the Nvidia one and the S SP 10471 ties into this mental expectation game we have in AI right now and expectations shape our reality when we collectively act on our expectations we are shaping what actually happens that bill could become law the Nvidia market cap is you know 3 4% lower right now what are your expectations and are they in line with reality
