# Product Building Strategy Part 1: How to build product for Dishwasher Problems

so your strategy for Building Products differs by the kind of paino you're solving I talked about this in a previous video but I want to talk about this just for one of the pain points I identified and do a real deep dive on it today that's the dishwasher problem the dishwasher problem is what happens when you solve a problem for someone and the result is invisible value you generally don't get credit for I don't give my dishwasher a lot of credit for solving the problem of washing dishes I probably should give it more value but I don't I'm a consumer and there's a lot of other products in our lives that are like that and that includes software products so if you think about that kind of pain point a few things emerge that describe that paino and help you to pin it down one of them is that almost everyone agrees on the parameters of the paino and that is not always true when you're describing product problems oftentimes customers will disagree with each other and give you conflicting feedback but with this kind of paino almost always people agree on the core issues they want solved please wash my dishes great right like that's the part that they want done and the Temptation and the and the defect I see there is that oftentimes product managers will hear that and then won't listen to it because they want to differentiate they want to differentiate by adding bells and whistles and Frills and we've all seen and in fact I think movies and media have Illustrated the problems that come with a bells and whistles solution to a dishwasher problem if you get an oven that has lots of fancy buttons and you don't know how to use it it's not much value is it but some product manager thought that it was value because it had a special kind of timer on it I guarantee you or maybe the timer talked to your iPhone but that's not why you bought the oven you bought the oven to cook chicken that's not why you bought the dishwasher your dishwasher didn't need to have a degree reading on your iPhone it just needed to wash the dishes and so many times I see companies I see product managers who misunderstand that kind of problem you are not going to get credit for solving this problem you're only going to get a slap on the wrist if you solve it badly and that is why we joke about those sort of overly complicated machines rub Goldberg machines is another word so what's a Better Way Forward A Better Way Forward is to look at the commonality which will be really high across the problem paino and to look at one of your three options in terms of your positioning in the market and what you have to do in the space you either are repairing to reach a previous state so maybe the software used to work before and now it has to work as well as it used to because it was a bad release you're not going to get credit for that that's a dishwasher problem maybe you're trying to reach parody with competitors you're not going to get credit for that that's a dishwasher problem maybe you are trying trying to build in a non- remarkable solution space people just don't care a lot about it they want it solved great but you're not going to get credit for it so let's let's talk about how you build in that space we've talked about the paino a little bit let's talk about what it looks like to actually build something whether or not you're building to repair to reach a previous state you're building for parody with competitors maybe you're just building in a non- remarkable Sol solution space and it's a new [Music] product at the end of the day there are a few things I want to call out here number one you need to make sure that you are focusing on the core functionality think of it as a just works test is it reliable is it low friction is it no drama is it super easy to onboard and use that is what people will actually judge your product on it's not going to be on the bells and whistles it's on whether it's there all the time and easy to use number two are you building for the full product Gap this is one of those cases where an MVP will not work a minimum viable product is not going to solve this you have to build for the entire product Gap if I had a dishwasher it would only wash my plates and only wash cups I would not buy it even if it did a great job at that because I need the full problem solved and I expect the full problem to be solved now this is actually an interesting sidebar at the end of the day part of the reason these kinds of products exist and these product opportunities exist is because they are in mature markets and so I'm I'm very aware that when the dishwasher was first released people made a much bigger deal out of it it was a big deal to get a dishwasher in a home it was not at all invisible value but now it's a mature market and now it is invisible value and you don't get credit for solving it in the same way customer expectations have changed in certain you know digital spaces we used to be over the moon as consumers when two-day shipping was true and it was a brand new thing I remember like a decade plus ago it was like oh my gosh it arrives in two days that's incredible not anymore I just look at it I'm like oh yeah it's going to arrive tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. fine bye I have no excitement it is it has been washed out of me and I think one of the things that you need to be honest about is if there's if there's not a ton of excitement in the space and you are building to solve a functional problem that consumers need solved you're not going to generate excitement from it don't try it's just not going to happen Okay so you have to build for the full product Gap you have to make sure you have a reliable low friction solution and you have to make sure that you are providing expected value this is actually not much of a space for surprising and delighting customers you need to just provide what they absolutely expect really really well there's almost no room for credit on the upside if you surprise and Delight them because the product category is so clearly described and the gaps are so clearly described that they've all been filled the surprise and Delight that would actually add functional value is almost certainly already in the market today and that's just one of the characteristics of this value set another example I was at Prime video my job was to start to build and close uh artwork artwork gaps so like if if a movie didn't have an image I needed to make sure it had one I got almost no credit for that because other companies like Netflix had this figured out and I needed to just make sure that the artwork was there so people could have a good browsing experience and pick a title to watch it didn't matter whether it was going to be an incredibly detailed handdrawn piece of artwork or not it just needed to be there clear associated with that particular title clearly descriptive and we move on people were not going to spend a lot of time on it they just wanted to know and recognize that Kung Fu Panda is Kung Fu Panda and keep going with their day so my job was to make things reliable and that's characteristic of a dishwasher problem and so my question to you if you are building in the dishwasher space Have you admitted to to yourself that this is not a glamorous thing to build have you admitted that the product Gap is probably fully described and all you have to do is build to close it have you admitted that rolling out is not going to get anybody a lot of credit but if you don't you'll get in trouble as a company those are the kinds of questions you should be asking yourself you should be asking yourself if you have the appetite to build in a space where you will be creating value that is really meaningful I appreciate that my dishwasher washes the dishes but not something I think about much right it's invisible value and that kind of circles back to the top and what I hinted at when I talked about the dishwasher problem and and invisible value at the end of the day this kind of problem is only solved when you are willing to make the value invisible and so my challenge to you if you're in this space is one recognize it and then two be willing to be the kind of PM that builds or the kind of engineer or the kind of entrepreneur that builds with invisible value if you do it well people appreciate it it's worth it right now the some some Toyota trucks are having I think the hux truck is having a real uh Renaissance of appreciation and it's not because it's a fancy truck it's not because of a Toyota ad campaign it's because they're built really well and every now and then customers will turn around and say oh wow this is built really well I really appreciate it but it's not a new new car it's not a new Mercedes it's not fancy it's being appreciated for the functional value it delivers it's being appreciated for its invisible value and that was a hard example to find because there almost no no examples out there of invisible value that's actually genuinely being appreciated uh so if that's you and you built it Toyota congratulations if it's the rest of us we have to assume that we probably won't get notice for the work even if it's really important and that is a breakdown of the dishwasher problem
